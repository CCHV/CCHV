\begin{abstract}
The aim of irradiation monitoring during a treatment in ion therapy is to control in real time the agreement between the delivered dose and the planned treatment. In fact, the discrepancies might come from uncertainties such as the planning accuracy by itself, or by variations due to the positioning or the anatomical changes of the patient. This can lead to ion-range variations of a few millimeters. Several devices are under development over the world to detect secondary radiations, which are correlated to the dose deposited by incident ions [1]. Compton cameras are in particular investigated for their potential high efficiency to detect prompt-gammas [2-5]. The present work aims at discussing the clinical applicability of a Compton camera design by means of Monte Carlo simulations validated against measurements of single and coincidence rates.

\section{Introduction}


%In 2012, cancer was the leading cause of death, causing 8.2 million deaths worldwide. Studies are showing that within two decades, cancer cases will increase from 14 million (2012) to 22 million [1]. The most frenquent cancers, for both sexes, are the lung, the breast, the colorectum, the prostate and the stomach cancer. Once detected, the cancer treatment requires surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. \newline
%A new type of radiotherapy emerged a few years ago: the ion therapy. The idea is to use charged paticles, like protons or carbon ions, to irradiate the patient instead of doing X-rays.
%There are mainly two advantages compare to the conventional radiotherapy using X-rays. Firstly, the balistic precision is higher for the ions due to the process of interaction in the matter. The ion energy is almost completely deposited in a small range (few millimeters) nammed Bragg peak. The normal tissues surrounding the tumor are therefore less irradiated. Secondly, the carbon ions have a better relative biological effectiveness compare to the X-rays in the Bragg peak region. It means that for the same amount of absorbed energy, the carbon ions are more effective [2].\newline

%The quality assurance in ion therapy appears mandatory in the light of the energies involved and need an irradiation monitoring in real time [ref]. 
%The aim of irradiation monitoring during a treatment in ion therapy is to control in real time the agreement between the delivered dose and the planned treatment. In fact, the discrepancies might come from uncertainties such as the planning accuracy by itself, or by variations due to the positioning or the anatomical changes of the patient. This can lead to ion-range variations of a few millimeters. 
%Several devices are under development, worldwide, to detect secondary radiations, which are correlated to the dose deposited by incident ions [3]. Compton cameras are particularly investigated for their potential high efficiency to detect prompt-gammas [4-7]. 
%In the group in Lyon, a Compton camera with electronic collimation was designed by GEANT4 9.6 simulations, in order to optimize the detection of prompt gammas and to discriminate the neutrons by the time of flight [8]. 
%According to the Monte Carlo design, a prototype, which is composed of three parts, is under development: a hodoscope , a scatterer and an absorber. The hodoscope is made of \newline 2 x 128 square scintillating fibers of one millimeter and represents a total area of 14.1$\rm{cm}^2$. The hodoscope is used to tag the incidents ions in time and position. The scatterer is a stack of seven double-sided silicon strip detectors of 90 x 90 x 2 $\rm{mm}^3$. Each silicon layer has 2 x 64 strips with a pitch of 1.41 mm. The absorber is composed of 96 blocks of streaked BGO of 38 x 35 x 30 $\rm{mm}^3$.  
%Dedicated electronic-readout systems have been homemade designed for the three detection systems. Moreover, a micro-TCA acquisition system is under development.
%All these developments' main goal is to verify in real time the accuracy of the irradiation. Therefore, it is mandatory to certify that the camera could work in clinical conditions. The main issues are the beam intensity and the time structure of the extraction from the accelerator. This time structure changes with the energy of the particles and type of accelerator (cyclotron or synchrotron). We simulate the detection of secondary particles, thanks to our Compton camera prototype, coming from the interaction between the incident ions (protons or carbon ions) and the target in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The clinical beam intensities and the time structure of the beam are taking into account to treat the results. To validate the results obtained by the simulations, we made an experiment at the Heidelberg Ion Therapy Center in Germany. A small prototype of the Compton camera was used (the full prototype is under construction) and we extrapolated the results to the full size prototype.

\section{Material and methods}

%For the purpose of this study, we have used Monte Carlo simulations Geant4. The group made experiments at different ion beam facilities. 

\subsection{Simulation setup\newline}


The simulation consists of the irradiation of a patient by an ion beam and the detection of the secondary particles emitted by mean of the Compton camera prototype. The patient is replaced by a cylindrical PMMA\footnotemark[1] phantom of 15 centimeters diameter and 20 centimeters length. The Compton camera prototype is composed by a scatterer, an absorber and a scintillating fiber hodoscope. The scatterer is a stack of seven layers of double-sided silicon strip detectors (DSSD) of 90 $\times$ 90 $\times$ 2 $\rm{mm}^3$ with 64 strips on each side. The absorber consists of 96 blocks of streaked BGO\footnotemark[2] crystals of 38 $\times$ 38 $\times$ 30 $\rm{mm}^3$. The hodoscope is formed by $2\times128$ square scintillating fibers of 1 $\rm{mm}^2$ and 140 mm length of BCF 12. The mechanical structures of the detectors, the scatterer's strips and the hodoscope are not modelled in this study. Moreover, the absorber is modelled by a monoblock of BGO crystal of 380 $\times$ 380 $\times$ 30 $\rm{mm}^3$ equivalent to 100 single blocks. The distance between the camera and the center of the PMMA phantom is set at 20 centimeters in order to fit with a realistic distance to the patient. The distance between each silicon layer is one centimeter and the distance from the last silicon layer to the absorber is 40 centimeters. The distance between the stack of silicon layers and the absorber is a compromise between the camera efficiency and the discrimination by time of flight measurement. The setup is described figure \ref{fig:fig_setup_CC_simulation_Hadronth}.\newline

%A Monte Carlo code is used to simulated the interaction of the ion in a phantom of PMMA and to simulated the detection of the secondary particle by a Compton Camera.

%The time-of-flight Compton camera prototype is composed of three parts: a hodoscope (2x128 square scintillating fibers), a stack of scatterers (seven Double-sided Silicon Strip Detector) and an absorber (96 blocks of streaked BGO).

\subsection{Hadronic models used in Geant4\newline}

The study is based on the Monte Carlo methods with the Geant4 toolkit, version 9.6 patch 02. Geant4 has been developed by the CERN for the high energy physics experiments. It was shown, that it could be also used in ion therapy studies \cite{cirrone_hadrontherapy_2011,toshito_new_2010}. However, some improvements remains to do in order to adjust the hadronic models \cite{dedes_assessment_2014} .
The interaction processes in the matter are described by means of different models according to the type of particles. A resume of those different models is given table \ref{table:table_modele_physic_CC_simulation_Hadronth}. Additionally, the Doppler broadening and the polarization is taking into account.

\subsection{Particles of interest}
\label{subsection:Particules_Etudiees_CC_hadrontherapy_Geant4}

We study the two main particles used in clinic, namely the protons and the carbon ions. The ion range of interest is 15.2 cm in the PMMA target. The energies associated to the range is 160 MeV for the protons and 305 MeV/n for the carbon ions. The beam delivered during a real treatment has a gaussian profile at the enter of the patient. The standard deviation for a proton beam is 5 mm at 160 MeV and 3.5 mm for a carbon ion beam at 305 MeV/n. The modelling of the Compton camera does not change with the type of incident particles. The statistic for a spot in pencil beam scanning (PBS) mode for protons is $10^8$ particles and $10^5$ particles for carbon ions. The beam time structure is applied during the post treatment.\newline


\subsection{Data treatment}
\label{subsection:Treatment_data_CC_hadrontherapy_Geant4}

\subsubsection{Detector's resolutions\newline}
\label{subsubsection:Resolution_detector_CC_hadrontherapy_Geant4}

The Monte Carlo simulation parameters are as close to reality as possible in order to get relevant results. The detector resolutions play an important role in the Compton camera performances. The absorber's spatial resolution influences the position of the apex of the Compton cone and influences its axis orientation. The energy resolution has effect on the  Compton cone aperture angle and the timing resolution impacts the coincidence windows between the absorber and the scatterer. The hodoscope is not included in the simulation but its timing resolution is taking into account for the time of flight discrimination. The detector resolutions are modelled in relation to the resolutions measured or estimated for each detector. The spatial resolution, the energy resolution and the timing resolution are presented in the table \ref{table:table_resolution_detecteurs_CC_simulation_Hadronth}.

%However, in order to simplify the geometry of the camera,  the strips are not modeled on the silicon layers and the monoblock of BGO is not divided into ninety six parts as it is in reality. Moreover, the hodoscope is not introduced in the simulations.

\subsubsection{Modelling of the ion beam structure\newline}
\label{subsubsection:modelisation_fasceau_ions_CC_hadrontherapy_Geant4}
 


The beam time structure should have a direct impact on the Compton camera capacities to detect a particle in coincidence between the scatterer and the absorber.
%A beam time structure is modeled and applied to the simulation data in order to estimate the coincidence rates (true/random) for a clinical application of the Compton camera. 
Two beam time structures have been modelled: one of IBA cyclotron C230 for protons (used in 16 clinical centers worldwide) and one of synchrotron installed at the Heidelberg Ion Therapy Center (HIT) in Germany for carbon ions. Depending the ion energy and the beam intensity, the beam microstructure will change. We are focusing in this study to the microstructure at a specific energy and at the influence of the variation of the intensity. In the case of protons at 160 MeV, the ions are grouped in bunches of 2 ns at a frequency of 106 MHz (9.42 ns) \cite{f_roellinghoff_real-time_2014}. The clinical beam intensity is 3.2 nA which corresponds to about 200 protons per bunch. Concerning the carbon ion beam at 305 MeV/u, the estimated microstructure is a bunch of 30 ns at a frequency of 5.9 MHz (170 ns). The clinical beam intensity for carbon ions is $5\times10^7$ ions/s which corresponds to about 9 ions per bunch This beam structure is extrapolated from measurements done by our team in 2013 at HIT. The time beam structure was measured for 200 MeV/u and 400 MeV/u carbon ions beam with a two scintillating fibers hodoscope and the spill signal given by the accelerator. The figure \ref{fig:fig_structure_temps_faisceau_HIT_2013_CC_simulation_Hadronth} shows the beam structure for carbon ions at 400 MeV/u. The pulses have a spill period of 150.2 ns and a bunch is 21.5 ns. A dedicated measure should be done for the energy of interest for this study (305 MeV/u).\newline
Moreover, the measurements have showed that the spill phase change during the extraction which involves that the HF signal from the synchrotron can not be used to locate the pulses. The use of the hodoscope seems required.\newline

%The Compton camera has to work for the highest beam intensity available during a treatment. 

%The IBA cyclotron C230 allows an intensity of 3.7 nA which corresponds to $2\times10^{10}$ protons/s in average. \newline
%The number of particles per packet (or bunch) is defined by the beam intensity and the spill period.    \newline
%Two types of configurations are taking into account for the detectors. In the first case, the detectors (silicon layer and the BGO) are considered as perfect in the point of view of timing resolution. Therefore, no timing resolution is applied and the coincidence window used to define a coincidence is the time of flight for a gamma ray to reach the silicon to the absorber. 
%The time defined to allow a coincidence between the scatterer and the absorber is forty nanoseconds. It is applied if the detectors are considered as real. The table 4 resumes those characteristics for specific ions.\newline

In the case of protons at 160 MeV, the ions are grouped in bunches of 2 ns at a frequency of 106 MHz (9.42 ns). The modification of the beam intensity will change the number of particles included in a bunch. For instance, at the clinical intensity in proton, there is in average 217 protons in a bunch. Concerning the carbon ion beam at 305 MeV/u, the estimated microstructure is a bunch of 30 ns at a frequency of 5.9 MHz (170 ns).\newline

In term of the coincidence between the scatterer and the absorber, we allow a time window of 40 ns around an absorber event. It means that for an event detected in the absorber, it will be flagged as a coincidence if an event (corresponding to a deposit energy) in one the scatterer layers is detected in a window of -20 ns and + 20 ns around the absorber event. This coincidence windows is defined regarding of the silicon timing resolution which is 15 ns at the full width at half maximum.

\subsubsection{Coincidence\newline}
\label{subsubsection:definition_coincidences_CC_hadrontherapy_Geant4}

A coincidence is defined as one energy deposit in the scatterer and one energy deposit in the absorber in a coincidence time windows given.
The Compton camera is based on a double interaction inside the scatterer and the absorber. However, a number of events will be considered as background: quasi-simultaneous interaction from 

%Cependant un certain nombre d'ÈvÈnements seront considÈrÈs comme du bruit de fond : interaction quasi-simultanÈe de deux particules secondaires dans le diffuseur et l'absorbeur, et double interaction d'une mÍme particule autre que par diffusion Compton d'un photon (par exemple une particule chargÈe qui traverserait un plan de silicium et l'absorbeur).\newline
%Lorsque deux particules interagissant respectivement dans le diffuseur pour l'une et dans l'absorbeur pour l'autre n'ont pas ÈtÈ crÈÈes par le mÍme ion incident, on parle de coÔncidence fortuite. En effet, si plusieurs ions incidents se trouvent dans le mÍme paquet, chacun des ions incidents va crÈer des particules secondaires en interagissant avec le patient. Il en rÈsulte qu'une particule correspondant ‡ l'ion$_1$ dÈpose de l'Ènergie dans un plan de silicium et qu'une particule correspondant ‡ l'ion$_2$ dÈpose de l'Ènergie dans l'absorbeur. Cette coÔncidence est appelÈe \textit{fortuite} ou \textit{random}. Dans le cas contraire, si les deux dÈpÙts d'Ènergie (dans le diffuseur et dans l'absorbeur) proviennent de particules issues d'un mÍme ion incident, alors on parle d'une coÔncidence \textit{vraie}.\newline
%¿ prÈsent, il est nÈcessaire d'affiner la dÈfinition d'une coÔncidence vraie qui contient diffÈrents cas de figure. Il est possible de mettre ces cas de figure dans deux catÈgories : les ÈvËnements indÈsirables \textit{background} ou les ÈvËnements d'intÈrÍt qui sont les photons gamma et que nous appellerons \textit{true gamma}.\newline
%La catÈgorie \textit{background} comprend :
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item …vËnements fortuits venant de deux ions incidents distincts.
%	\item Une mÍme particule dÈposant de l'Ènergie dans le diffuseur et l'absorbeur, mais n'Ètant pas un photon gamma	: proton, neutron, Èlectron.
%	\item Deux particules distinctes gÈnÈrÈes par le mÍme ion incident et dont l'une interagit dans un plan de silicium et l'autre dans l'absorbeur BGO. Toutes les combinaisons sont possibles, telles que par exemple : deux photons gamma, un proton et un photon gamma, un proton et un neutron, etc.\newline

%La deuxiËme catÈgorie \textit{true gamma} est celle que l'on souhaite dÈtecter avec le moins d'ÈvËnements \textit{background} possible. Comme explicitÈ plus haut, on sÈlectionne les photons gamma ayant diffusÈ dans un plan de silicium puis absorbÈs dans l'absorbeur. Parmi ces ÈvËnements, il est possible de distinguer les photons gamma crÈÈs par une rÈaction nuclÈaire de l'ion incident et le lieu de cette crÈation va donner une information relative au parcours de l'ion. On peut diffÈrencier ces photons par rapport ‡ ceux ayant diffusÈ, une ou plusieurs fois, dans le patient avant d'Ítre dÈtectÈs par la camÈra Compton. Les photons ayant ÈtÈ crÈÈs par le processus d'annihilation sont Ègalement pris en compte dans la catÈgorie \textit{true gamma}, mais ne renseignent pas sur le parcours de l'ion car ils ne se sont pas directement crÈÈs par l'interaction de l'ion lui-mÍme. La figure \ref{fig:fig_explication_coincidence_CC_simulation_Hadronth} reprend les diffÈrentes dÈfinitions des coÔncidences.

As mentioned before, a coincidence is defined as an energy deposit in one silicon layer of the scatterer stack and an energy deposit in the BGO absorber. The deposit energies in the detectors can come from the same particle or can come from two different one. In the case of distinct radiations, if the the two particles are originated from the same incident ion on the target, the coincidence is named true coincidence. Otherwise, if this is not, so the coincidence is named a random coincidence. A more detailed analysis leads to separate the true coincidences in subparts.
\begin{itemize}
%	\item All the true coincidences is analyzed 
	\item The same secondary particle interacts in the scatterer and the absorber and make a coincidence. The secondary particle can be:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A gamma ray.
		\item An other type of charged particles: neutron, proton, electron.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Two different types of secondary particle makes a coincidence: one interacts in the scatterer and the other in the absorber.
\end{itemize}
As the Compton camera's goal is to detect the gamma's scattering in the scatterer then its full absorption in the absorber, a coincidence corresponding to this definition is named a true gamma coincidence. The other type of coincidences is labeled background.


\subsubsection{Time of flight discrimination and energy cuts\newline}

\textit{Time of flight (TOF) information}\newline

The objective is to eliminate the massive or charged particles (proton, electron, neutron) creating a coincidence in the Compton camera thanks to their speed. In fact, the photons are moving at the light speed when the other particles are moving slower due to their mass. To discriminate the particles with their speed, the time information coming from the hodoscope and the time information coming from the absorber are used. The difference between those informations is named time of flight (equation 1). However, the hodoscope is not modeling in this study. As the Monte Carlo code consists to follow all story individually, the time between the incident particle's creation and the secondary particle detection in the absorber is considered as the time of flight. Moreover, the hodoscope has a timing resolution about one nanosecond at full width at half maximum, so it is taking into account in the TOF estimation.

\begin{eqnarray*}
TOF_{theoretical} = t_{absorber}-t_{hodoscope}\\
TOF_{simulation} = t_{absorber}+t_{creation} + u_{hodoscope}
\end{eqnarray*}
With $u_{hodoscope}$  the hodoscope resolution modeled by a gaussian with a sigma of 1/2.35 ns. 

The time of flight spectrum resulting from the simulation shows that the coincidences of interest are included in a window between 0 and 6 ns (Fig. X). Therefore, all the coincidences with a TOF higher than 6 ns will be excluded of the results.

	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./Figure/Material_Methods/2014_10_15_1Proton_TOF_Spectrum_NO_cutTOF.jpg}
	\end{figure}

\textit{Energy cuts}\newline

Energy triggers are also defined for the detectors: 50 keV for the silicon layers and 100 keV for the absorber. An additional energy cut is practiced to the total energy absorbed in the camera and it is set at one MeV. In fact, the main gamma rays of interest have an energy upper at one MeV.

\subsection{Reconstruction algorithm\newline}

A simple method is used to reconstructed the emission position of the events detect in coincidence: the reconstruction line-cone. Thanks to the energies deposited in the detectors and the interaction positions, a cone is calculated which contains the event emission point. The energies enable to calculate the aperture of the Compton's cone by way of the following equation:

\begin{equation}
cos(\theta_{Compton}) = 1-m_ec^2\left(\frac{1}{E_{absorber}}-\frac{1}{E_{initial}}\right)
\end{equation}

	
With $E_{initial} = E_{absorber} + E_{silicon}$\newline
$E_{absorber}$ the energy deposited in the absorber and $E_{silicon}$ the energy deposited in the scatterer.\newline

We assume that the initial energy of the gamma ray is fully absorbed in the absorber. This hypothesis combined to the detector energy resolutions lead to a potentiel uncertainty on the cone aperture. The interaction position in the scatter gives the cone apex and the position in the absorber gives the cone axis. The intersection of all the reconstructed cones gives the emission source point. In order to simplify the reconstruction and limit the possibilities, the beam direction is used to obtain just two solutions: the beam direction intersects the cone in two points. Only one of those solutions is the good one and the other will give a wrong information. As the original position is unknown when the gamma ray is detected in coincidence, the results presented in the next section take into account the two solutions.\newline

%	The other possibilities (except the same gamma ray) are regrouped. For instance, this subsection is composed by coincidences of two different kinds of particles, two different gamma rays or the same particle but different than gamma\newline
%According to the type of the coincidence, a distinction can be done. 


%The random coincidence occurs  when the energies deposited in the scatterer and the absorber are induced by radiations coming from two different incident particles (on the target). The true coincidence is on contrary when  the energies deposited in the scatterer and the absorber are induced by one or several radiations coming from a single incident particle.
%The true coincidence can also be divided into three subsections to refine the analysis:

\subsection{Beam intensity \newline}
Je traite les simulations pour une statistique de $10^{8}$ pour les protons et une statistique de $2\times10^{5}$ pour les ions carbone.\newline
J'assigne ‡ chaque particule interagissant dans le diffuseur et l'absorbeur un numÈro de paquet auquel elle est thÈoriquement rattachÈe au vu de la structure en temps choisie et de l'intensitÈ du faisceau.
The modification of the beam intensity will change the number of particles included in a bunch. For instance, at the clinical intensity in proton, there is in average 217 protons in a bunch.



The beam intensity plays an important role for the Compton camera concerning its capability to distinct events in coincidence. In the simulation, the beam intensity is modeled by an average number of particles per bunch. The exact number of particles in each bunch is given by a random draw in a Poisson distribution, where the mean value is the beam intensity chosen. The range of intensities was chosen in order to cover almost all the possibilities: from a very low beam intensity to the clinical beam intensity. Therefore, for proton and carbon ion, the lowest beam intensity is set to 0.001 particles per bunch in average and for protons goes up to 217 protons per bunch when in case of carbon ion, it goes up to 70 particles per bunch. The coincidence yields are scaled per ion incidents and the beam intensity per average ions per bunch. The true coincidences represent a coincidence in the camera by the same gamma ray. The background corresponds to all the other coincidence types.


\begin{figure} [!h]
\caption{Coincidences yield for protons (a) and carbon ions (b) in function of the beam intensity. The intensity is given for a number of incident particles per bunch.  The distinction between the filled markers and the empty ones are that the time of flight discrimination is applied in the case of empty markers.}

  \label{}
\end{figure}

\newpage
At the clinical beam intensity, the high background level is mainly due to the random coincidences. In fact, the probability to detect two radiations coming from two different incident particles increases with the number of incident particles per bunch. An other issue is the single rate of events detected by each detectors at those high intensities. For instance, at the clinic beam intensity in proton therapy, the single rate on the absorber is around 300 MHz and on the first silicon layer it is around 20 MHz. The current electronic front end and acquisition system are not able to treat this amount of data coming from all the detectors. As a result, it appears that it is impossible to use the Compton camera at a clinical beam intensity for the treatment monitoring in ion therapy.\newline
Nevertheless, if the intensity decreases enough to avoid almost all the random coincidences, the monitoring seems more feasible. In addition, it can be suppose that the time of flight discrimination will improve the signal to background ratio at low intensities by suppress the coincidences induced by charged particles. Indeed, the charged particles are slower than gamma rays which move at the light speed.\newline

%\subsubsection{Reconstruction vertex\newline}
%
%Appart from the coincidence yield, which inform in a first analysis the technical feasibility, the emission position reconstruction provides to the physicist the material to detect if the Bragg peak is in the tumor or out of the limit. The photon's emission position is reconstructed by means of the line cone method (described in the previous section). The time of flight discrimination and energy cuts are applied. \newline
%To highlight the impossibility to monitor the treatment at the clinical beam intensity, the reconstructed vertex is given at the high nominal intensity and at an intensity of one particle per bunch. The figure X presents the number of reconstructed events per incident ion in function of the PMMA target depth along the beam axis. The target starts at - 100 mm and finishes at + 100 mm. The Bragg peak position is around + 50 mm. The statistic used for the figures is the spot scale for protons ($10^8$) and an energy slice for carbon ions ($4\times 10^7$). The curves represent the same data types than the figure X.

%\caption{On one hand (a)(b), there is the comparaison between the reconstructed vertex at the clinical beam intensity (217 protons/bunch) and at a realistic beam intensity for the monitoring (1 proton/bunch). On the other hand (c)(d), the same comparaison for a carbon ion beam at the clinical intensity (9 ions/bunch) and a lower intensity (1 ion/bunch). In both cases, the number of reconstructed events per incident ion is represented in function of the PMMA target depth along the beam axis. }

%For the protons, a clear drop can be distinguished at the Bragg Peak position (+ 50 mm). The background is at a enough low level to exploit directly the falloff information and control the treatment. On the other hand, the profile shape obtained in carbon is hardly workable.  \textcolor{red}{add something here on the carbon profile shape.}\newline
%The intensity reduction after one particle per bunch will lightly improve the signal to background ratio but the random coincidences are yet almost eliminate at these intensity.

%Using the \verb"eqnarray" environment equations will naturally be aligned left without the use of any ampersands for alignment, see equations (\ref{eq1}) and (\ref{eq2})
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\alpha + \beta =\gamma^2 \label{eq1}\\
%\alpha^2 + 2\gamma + \cos\theta = \delta \label{eq2} 
%\end{eqnarray}
%This is the normal equation style for our journals.
%
%Where some secondary alignment is needed, for instance a second part of an equation on a second line, a single ampersand is added at the point of alignment in each line  (see  (\ref{eq3}) and (\ref{eq4})).
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\alpha &=2\gamma^2 + \cos\theta + \frac{XY \sin\theta}{X+ Y\cos\theta} \label{eq3}\\
% & = \delta\theta PQ \cos\gamma. \label{eq4} 
%\end{eqnarray}
% 
%Two points of alignment are possible using two ampersands for alignment (see  (\ref{eq5}) and (\ref{eq6})).  Note in this case extra space \verb"\qquad" is added before the second ampersand in the longest line (the top one) to separate the condition from the equation. 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\alpha &=2\gamma^2 + \cos\theta + \frac{XY \sin\theta}{X+ Y\cos\theta}\qquad& \theta > 1 \label{eq5}\\
% & = \delta\theta PQ \cos\gamma &\theta \leq 1\label{eq6} 
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%For a long equation which has to be split over more than one line the first line should start at the left margin, this is achieved by inserting \verb"\fl" (full left) at the start of the line, the use of the alignment parameter \verb"&" is not necessary unless some secondary alignment is needed.
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\fl \alpha + 2\gamma^2 = \cos\theta + \frac{XY \sin\theta}{X+ Y\cos\theta} +  \frac{XY \sin\theta}{X- Y\cos\theta} +
%+ \left(\frac{XY \sin\theta}{X+ Y\cos\theta}\right)^2 \nonumber\\
%+  \left(\frac{XY \sin\theta}{X- Y\cos\theta}\right)^2\label{eq7} 
%\end{eqnarray}
%
