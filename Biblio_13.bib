The formula exploits a large proportion of the acquired events and is easy to implement into fast algorithms. We give for it two equivalent formulations relying on known properties of the two-dimensional Radon transform and we test a semi-iterative algorithm for one of them. From a practical point of view, methods robust to measurement noise and to low number of events are required. We show that adding a constraint on the total variation of the final image strongly improves the results. We illustrate our arguments with Monte-Carlo simulated data in both low and realistic noise configurations.}

	Abstract = {The main advantages of proton therapy are the reduced total energy deposited in the patient as compared to photon techniques and the finite range of the proton beam. The latter adds an additional degree of freedom to treatment planning. The range in tissue is associated with considerable uncertainties caused by imaging, patient setup, beam delivery and dose calculation. Reducing the uncertainties would allow a reduction of the treatment volume and thus allow a better utilization of the advantages of protons. This article summarizes the role of Monte Carlo simulations when aiming at a reduction of range uncertainties in proton therapy. Differences in dose calculation when comparing Monte Carlo with analytical algorithms are analyzed as well as range uncertainties due to material constants and CT conversion. Range uncertainties due to biological effects and the role of Monte Carlo for in vivo range verification are discussed. Furthermore, the current range uncertainty recipes used at several proton therapy facilities are revisited. We conclude that a significant impact of Monte Carlo dose calculation can be expected in complex geometries where local range uncertainties due to multiple Coulomb scattering will reduce the accuracy of analytical algorithms. In these cases Monte Carlo techniques might reduce the range uncertainty by several mm.},

	Abstract = {We describe a novel approach to treatment planning for heavy-ion radiotherapy based on the local effect model (LEM) which allows us to calculate the biologically effective dose not only for the target region but also for the entire irradiation volume. LEM is ideally suited for use as an integral part of treatment planning code systems for active dose shaping devices like the GSI raster scan system. Thus it has been incorporated into our standard treatment planning system for ion therapy (TRiP). Single intensity modulated fields can be optimized with respect to a homogeneous biologically effective dose. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) is calculated separately for each voxel of the patient CT. Our radiobiologically oriented code system has been used since 1995 for the planning of irradiation experiments with cell cultures and animals such as rats and minipigs. It has been in regular and successful use for patient treatment planning since 1997.},

@article{Knopf:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Protons are an interesting modality for radiotherapy because of their well defined range and favourable depth dose characteristics. On the other hand, these same characteristics lead to added uncertainties in their delivery. This is particularly the case at the distal end of proton dose distributions, where the dose gradient can be extremely steep. In practice however, this gradient is rarely used to spare critical normal tissues due to such worries about its exact position in the patient. Reasons for this uncertainty are inaccuracies and non-uniqueness of the calibration from CT Hounsfield units to proton stopping powers, imaging artefacts (e.g. due to metal implants) and anatomical changes of the patient during treatment. In order to improve the precision of proton therapy therefore, it would be extremely desirable to verify proton range in vivo, either prior to, during, or after therapy. In this review, we describe and compare state-of-the art in vivo proton range verification methods currently being proposed, developed or clinically implemented.},

  abstract={Monte Carlo simulations play a crucial role for in-vivo treatment monitoring based on PET and prompt gamma imaging in proton and carbon-ion therapies. The accuracy of the nuclear fragmentation models implemented in these codes might affect the quality of the treatment verification. In this paper, we investigate the nuclear models implemented in GATE/Geant4 and FLUKA by comparing the angular and energy distributions of secondary particles exiting a homogeneous target of PMMA. Comparison results were restricted to fragmentation of 16 O and 12 C. Despite the very simple target and set-up, substantial discrepancies were observed between the two codes. For instance, the number of high energy (>1 MeV) prompt gammas exiting the target was about twice as large with GATE/Geant4 than with FLUKA both for proton and carbon ion beams. Such differences were not observed for the predicted annihilation photon production yields, for which ratios of 1.09 and 1.20 were obtained between GATE and FLUKA for the proton beam and the carbon ion beam, respectively. For neutrons and protons, discrepancies from 14% (exiting protons–carbon ion beam) to 57% (exiting neutrons–proton beam) have been identified in production yields as well as in the energy spectra for neutrons.}

  abstract={Compton imaging is a useful method to localize gamma sources without using mechanical collimators. In conventional Compton imaging, the incident directions of gamma rays are estimated in a cone for each event by analyzing the sequence of interactions of each gamma ray followed by Compton kinematics. Since the information of the ejection directions of the recoil electrons is lost, many artifacts in the shape of cone traces are generated, which reduces signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and angular resolution. We have developed an advanced Compton imaging system with the capability of tracking recoil electrons by using a combination of a trigger-mode silicon-on-insulator (SOI) pixel detector and a GAGG detector. This system covers the 660–1330 keV energy range for localization of contamination nuclides such as 137 Cs and 134 Cs inside the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan. The ejection directions of recoil electrons caused by Compton scattering are detected on the micro-pixelated SOI detector, which can theoretically be used to determine the incident directions of the gamma rays in a line for each event and can reduce the appearance of artifacts. We obtained 2-D reconstructed images from the first iteration of the proposed system for 137 Cs, and the SNR and angular resolution were enhanced compared with those of conventional Compton imaging systems.}

  abstract={In this paper we report on Monte Carlo simulations to investigate real-time monitoring of the track depth profile in particle therapy by measuring prompt gamma ray emissions: a high sensitivity imaging system employing a knife-edge-shaped slit combined with a position-sensitive gamma detector was evaluated. Calculations to test this new concept were performed for a head-sized software phantom. Clear spatial correlation is shown between the distribution of gamma rays detected with energies above 1.5 MeV and the distribution of prompt gamma rays emitted from the phantom. The number of neutrons originating from nuclear reactions in the phantom that are detected at these high energies is small. Most importantly it is shown that under common therapy conditions enough data may be collected during one spot-step (of the order of 10 ms) to locate the distal dose edge with a 1σ accuracy of better than 1 mm. This indicates that simple slit cameras have high potential for accurate real-time particle therapy adjustment and may become a practical way to improve particle therapy accuracy.}

	Abstract = {Treatments delivered by proton therapy are affected by uncertainties on the range of the beam within the patient, requiring medical physicists to add safety margins on the penetration depth of the beam. To reduce these margins and deliver safer treatments, different projects are currently investigating real-time range control by imaging prompt gammas emitted along the proton tracks in the patient. This study reports on the feasibility, development and test of a new concept of prompt gamma camera using a slit collimator to obtain a one-dimensional projection of the beam path on a scintillation detector. This concept was optimized, using the Monte Carlo code MCNPX version 2.5.0, to select high energy photons correlated with the beam range and detect them with both high statistics and sufficient spatial resolution. To validate the Monte Carlo model, spectrometry measurements of secondary particles emitted by a PMMA target during proton irradiation at 160 MeV were realized. An excellent agreement with the simulations was observed when using subtraction methods to isolate the gammas in direct incidence. A first prototype slit camera using the HiCam gamma detector was consequently prepared and tested successfully at 100 and 160 MeV beam energies. Results confirmed the potential of this concept for real-time range monitoring with millimetre accuracy in pencil beam scanning mode for typical clinical conditions. If we neglect electronic dead times and rejection of detected events, the current solution with its collimator at 15 cm from the beam axis can achieve a 1-2 mm standard deviation on range estimation in a homogeneous PMMA target for numbers of protons that correspond to doses in water at the Bragg peak as low as 15 cGy at 100 MeV and 25 cGy at 160 MeV assuming pencil beams with a Gaussian profile of 5 mm sigma at target entrance.},

@article{RBE_Weyrather,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The LET position of the RBE maximum and its dependence on the cellular repair capacity was determined for carbon ions. Hamster cell lines of differing repair capacity were irradiated with monoenergetic carbon ions. RBE values for cell inactivation at different survival levels were determined and the differences in the RBE-LET patterns were compared with the individual sensitivity to photon irradiation of the different cell lines. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three hamster cell lines, the wild-type cell lines V79 and CHO-K1 and the radiosensitive CHO mutant xrs5, were irradiated with carbon ions of different energies (2.4-266.4 MeV/u) and LET values (13.7-482.7 keV/microm) and inactivation data were measured in comparison to 250 kV x-rays. RESULTS: For the repair-proficient cell lines a RBE maximum was found at LET values between 150 and 200 keV/microm. For the repair-deficient cell line the RBE failed to show a maximum and decreased continuously for LET values above 100 keV/microm. CONCLUSIONS: The carbon RBE LET relationship for inactivation is shifted to higher LET values compared with protons and alpha-particles. RBE correlated with the repair capacity of the cells.},

@article{Golnik:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Proton and ion beams open up new vistas for the curative treatment of tumors, but adequate technologies for monitoring the compliance of dose delivery with treatment plans in real time are still missing. Range assessment, meaning the monitoring of therapy-particle ranges in tissue during dose delivery (treatment), is a continuous challenge considered a key for tapping the full potential of particle therapies. In this context the paper introduces an unconventional concept of range assessment by prompt-gamma timing (PGT), which is based on an elementary physical effect not considered so far: therapy particles penetrating tissue move very fast, but still need a finite transit time--about 1-2 ns in case of protons with a 5-20 cm range--from entering the patient's body until stopping in the target volume. The transit time increases with the particle range. This causes measurable effects in PGT spectra, usable for range verification. The concept was verified by proton irradiation experiments at the AGOR cyclotron, KVI-CART, University of Groningen. Based on the presented kinematical relations, we describe model calculations that very precisely reproduce the experimental results. As the clinical treatment conditions entail measurement constraints (e.g. limited treatment time), we propose a setup, based on clinical irradiation conditions, capable of determining proton range deviations within a few seconds of irradiation, thus allowing for a fast safety survey. Range variations of 2 mm are expected to be clearly detectable.},

	Abstract = {We present an experimental study of a novel method to verify the range of proton therapy beams. Differential cross sections were measured for 15 prompt gamma-ray lines from proton-nuclear interactions with (12)C and (16)O at proton energies up to 150 MeV. These cross sections were used to model discrete prompt gamma-ray emissions along proton pencil-beams. By fitting detected prompt gamma-ray counts to these models, we simultaneously determined the beam range and the oxygen and carbon concentration of the irradiated matter. The performance of the method was assessed in two phantoms with different elemental concentrations, using a small scale prototype detector. Based on five pencil-beams with different ranges delivering 5 x 10(8) protons and without prior knowledge of the elemental composition at the measurement point, the absolute range was determined with a standard deviation of 1.0-1.4 mm. Relative range shifts at the same dose level were detected with a standard deviation of 0.3-0.5 mm. The determined oxygen and carbon concentrations also agreed well with the actual values. These results show that quantitative prompt gamma-ray measurements enable knowledge of nuclear reaction cross sections to be used for precise proton range verification in the presence of tissue with an unknown composition.},

The target entrance rise and the Bragg peak falloff retrieval precision was determined as a function of incident proton number by a fitting procedure using independent data sets.

	Abstract = {Proton and ion beam therapies become increasingly relevant in radiation therapy. To fully exploit the potential of this irradiation technique and to achieve maximum target volume conformality, the verification of particle ranges is highly desirable. Many research activities focus on the measurement of the spatial distributions of prompt gamma rays emitted during irradiation. A passively collimating knife-edge slit camera is a promising option to perform such measurements. In former publications, the feasibility of accurate detection of proton range shifts in homogeneous targets could be shown with such a camera. We present slit camera measurements of prompt gamma depth profiles in inhomogeneous targets. From real treatment plans and their underlying CTs, representative beam paths are selected and assembled as one-dimensional inhomogeneous targets built from tissue equivalent materials. These phantoms have been irradiated with monoenergetic proton pencil beams. The accuracy of range deviation estimation as well as the detectability of range shifts is investigated in different scenarios. In most cases, range deviations can be detected within less than 2 mm. In close vicinity to low-density regions, range detection is challenging. In particular, a minimum beam penetration depth of 7 mm beyond a cavity is required for reliable detection of a cavity filling with the present setup. Dedicated data post-processing methods may be capable of overcoming this limitation.},

	Abstract = {In this work, we investigate the use of a three-stage Compton camera to measure secondary prompt gamma rays emitted from patients treated with proton beam radiotherapy. The purpose of this study was (1) to develop an optimal three-stage Compton camera specifically designed to measure prompt gamma rays emitted from tissue and (2) to determine the feasibility of using this optimized Compton camera design to measure and image prompt gamma rays emitted during proton beam irradiation. The three-stage Compton camera was modeled in Geant4 as three high-purity germanium detector stages arranged in parallel-plane geometry. Initially, an isotropic gamma source ranging from 0 to 15 MeV was used to determine lateral width and thickness of the detector stages that provided the optimal detection efficiency. Then, the gamma source was replaced by a proton beam irradiating a tissue phantom to calculate the overall efficiency of the optimized camera for detecting emitted prompt gammas. The overall calculated efficiencies varied from approximately 10(-6) to 10(-3) prompt gammas detected per proton incident on the tissue phantom for several variations of the optimal camera design studied. Based on the overall efficiency results, we believe it feasible that a three-stage Compton camera could detect a sufficient number of prompt gammas to allow measurement and imaging of prompt gamma emission during proton radiotherapy.},

	Abstract = {In order to exploit the advantages of ion-beam therapy in a clinical setting, delivery verification techniques are necessary to detect deviations from the planned treatment. Efforts are currently oriented towards the development of devices for real-time range monitoring. Among the different detector concepts proposed, Compton cameras are employed to detect prompt gammas and represent a valid candidate for real-time range verification. We present the first on-beam test of MACACO, a Compton telescope (multi-layer Compton camera) based on lanthanum bromide crystals and silicon photo-multipliers. The Compton telescope was first characterized through measurements and Monte Carlo simulations. The detector linearity was measured employing (22)Na and Am-Be sources, obtaining about 10% deviation from linearity at 3.44 MeV. A spectral image reconstruction algorithm was tested on synthetic data. Point-like sources emitting gamma rays with energy between 2 and 7 MeV were reconstructed with 3-5 mm resolution. The two-layer Compton telescope was employed to measure radiation emitted from a beam of 150 MeV protons impinging on a cylindrical PMMA target. Bragg-peak shifts were achieved via adjustment of the PMMA target location and the resulting measurements used during image reconstruction. Reconstructed Bragg peak profiles proved sufficient to observe peak-location differences within 10 mm demonstrating the potential of the MACACO Compton Telescope as a monitoring device for ion-beam therapy.},

  abstract={The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the ability of a prototype Compton camera (CC) to measure prompt gamma rays (PG) emitted during delivery of clinical proton pencil beams for prompt gamma imaging (PGI) as a means of providing in vivo verification of the delivered proton radiotherapy beams. A water phantom was irradiated with clinical 114 MeV and 150 MeV proton pencil beams. Up to 500 cGy of dose was delivered per irradiation using clinical beam currents. The prototype CC was placed 15 cm from the beam central axis and PGs from 0.2 MeV up to 6.5 MeV were measured during irradiation. From the measured data (2D) images of the PG emission were reconstructed. (1D) profiles were extracted from the PG images and compared to measured depth dose curves of the delivered proton pencil beams. The CC was able to measure PG emission during delivery of both 114 MeV and 150 MeV proton beams at clinical beam currents. 2D images of the PG emission were reconstructed for single 150 MeV proton pencil beams as well as for a 5   ×   5 cm mono-energetic layer of 114 MeV pencil beams. Shifts in the Bragg peak (BP) range were detectable on the 2D images. 1D profiles extracted from the PG images show that the distal falloff of the PG emission profile lined up well with the distal BP falloff. Shifts as small as 3 mm in the beam range could be detected from the 1D PG profiles with an accuracy of 1.5 mm or better. However, with the current CC prototype, a dose of 400 cGy was required to acquire adequate PG signal for 2D PG image reconstruction. It was possible to measure PG interactions with our prototype CC during delivery of proton pencil beams at clinical dose rates. Images of the PG emission could be reconstructed and shifts in the BP range were detectable. Therefore PGI with a CC for in vivo range verification during proton treatment delivery is feasible. However, improvements in the prototype CC detection efficiency and reconstruction algorithms are necessary to make it a clinically viable PGI system.}

	Abstract = {A Compton imaging method for medical applications that includes new energy determination and data filtering techniques has been tested using several point sources with known emission lines. Using a prototype Compton camera, a distance-of-closest approach technique has been employed to determine the initial energy of the incoming gammas and to ensure the reconstructed source position is within an acceptable distance from the known gamma source location. Further analysis is done by implementing a Compton line filtering technique, keeping only those interactions whose deposited energy in the first interaction matches the theoretical energy deposition predicted by the Compton equation. Using this new event filtering method, we see improvements in the full width at half maximum in the lateral profiles of gamma point sources of up to 70% over standard Compton imaging methods, as well as achievable spatial resolutions in the reconstructed images of better than 2 mm. In addition, this new Compton imaging method was able to reconstruct an extended source of gamma rays emitted during irradiation of a water tank with a clinical proton radiotherapy beam.},

	Abstract = {Monte Carlo tools have been long used to assist the research and development of solutions for proton therapy monitoring. The present work focuses on the prompt-gamma emission yields by comparing experimental data with the outcomes of the current version of Geant4 using all applicable proton inelastic models. For the case in study and using the binary cascade model, it was found that Geant4 overestimates the prompt-gamma emission yields by 40.2 $\pm$0.3{\%}, even though it predicts the prompt-gamma profile length of the experimental profile accurately. In addition, the default implementations of all proton inelastic models show an overestimation in the number of prompt gammas emitted. Finally, a set of built-in options and physically sound Geant4 source code changes have been tested in order to try to improve the discrepancy observed. A satisfactory agreement was found when using the QMD model with a wave packet width equal to 1.3 fm(2).},

	abstract = {The problem of reconstructing a 3D source distribution from Compton scattered data can be separated into two tasks. First, the angular distribution of line projections at different observation points within the detector volume are reconstructed. Then, reconstruction techniques are applied to the resulting cone-beam projections to synthesize the 3D source distribution. This paper describes an analytic solution for the first, yet unsolved, task. Building on the convolution theorem in spherical coordinates, a backprojection and inverse filtering technique in terms of spherical harmonics is formulated. The rotation invariance of the point response of the backprojection in spherical coordinates is proved; and the corresponding inverse filter function is derived. The resulting filtered backprojection algorithm then consists of a summation over all detected events of fixed and known event response functions. Measurement errors, which for Compton scatter detectors are typically different for each detected event, can easily be accounted for in the proposed algorithm. The computational cost of the algorithm is O(NT2), where N is the number of detected events and π/T is the desired angular resolution},

Calculations to test this new concept were performed for a head-sized software phantom. Clear spatial correlation is shown between the distribution of gamma rays detected with energies above 1.5 MeV and the distribution of prompt gamma rays emitted from the phantom. The number of neutrons originating from nuclear reactions in the phantom that are detected at these high energies is small. Most importantly it is shown that under common therapy conditions enough data may be collected during one spot-step (of the order of 10 ms) to locate the distal dose edge with a 1σ accuracy of better than 1 mm. This indicates that simple slit cameras have high potential for accurate real-time particle therapy adjustment and may become a practical way to improve particle therapy accuracy.},

The dose delivered in particle therapy can be described as the integral of fluence times the total mass stopping power over the particle energy distributions. We employed Monte Carlo simulations to explore the influence on the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the energy and the energy spread of the proton beam incident on a range modulator system. Using different beams, the conditions of beam delivery were adjusted so that similar spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) doses were delivered to a simulated water phantom. We calculated the RBE for inactivation of three different cell lines using the track structure model. The RBE depends on the details of the dose deposition and the biological characteristics of the irradiated tissue. Our calculations show that, for differing beam conditions, the corresponding differences in the total mass stopping power distributions are reflected in differences in the RBE. However, these differences are remarkable only at the very distal edge of the SOBP, for low doses, and/or for large differences in beam setup.},

This leads to huge gains in sensitivity and, consequently, a reduction in the radiation dosage that needs to be administered to the patient. Design modifications that improve the sensitivity invariably compromise resolution. The scope of the current project was to determine an optimal design and configuration of a Compton camera that strikes a balance between these two properties. Transport of the photon flux from the source to the detectors was simulated with the camera geometry serving as the parameter to be optimized. Two variations of the Boltzmann photon transport equation, with and without photon polarization, were employed to model the flux. Doppler broadening of the energy spectra was also included. The simulation was done in a Monte Carlo framework using GEANT4. Two clinically relevant energies, 140 keV and 511 keV, corresponding to 99m Tc and 18 F were simulated. The gain in the sensitivity for the Compton camera over the conventional camera was 100 fold. Neither Doppler broadening nor polarization had any significant effect on the sensitivity of the camera. However, the spatial resolution of the camera was affected by these processes. Doppler broadening had a deleterious effect on the spatial resolution, but polarization improved the resolution when accounted for in the reconstruction algorithm.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The goal of this study is to present the Discovery NM 530c (DNM), a cardiac SPECT camera, interfacing multi-pinhole collimators with solid-state modules, aiming at slashing acquisition time without jeopardizing quality. DNM resembles PET since it enables 3-D SPECT without detector motion. We further envision how these novel capabilities may help with current and future challenges of cardiac imaging.
METHODS: DNM sensitivity, spatial resolution (SR) and energy resolution (ER), count rate response, cardiac uniformity and cardiac defect contrast were measured and compared to a dedicated cardiac, dual-head standard SPECT (S-SPECT) camera.
RESULTS: DNM sensitivity was more than threefold higher while SR was notably better. Significantly, SR was the same for (99m)Tc and (201)Tl. ER was improved on DNM and allowed good separation of (99m)Tc and (123)I spectral peaks. Count rate remained linear on DNM up to 612 kcps, while S-SPECT showed severe dead time limitations. Phantom studies revealed comparable uniformity and defect contrast, notwithstanding significantly shorter acquisition time for the DNM. First patient images, including dynamic SPECT, are also presented.
CONCLUSION: DNM is raising the bar for expedition and upgrade of practice. It features high sensitivity as well as improved SR, temporal resolution and ER. It enables reduction of acquisition time and fast protocols. Importantly, it is potentially capable of dynamic 3-D acquisition. The new technology is potentially upgradeable and may become a milestone in the evolution of nuclear cardiology as it assumes its key role in molecular imaging of the heart.},

	abstract = {In this work, we present experimental results of a novel prompt gamma-ray detector for proton beam range verification. The detection system features an actively shielded cerium-doped lanthanum(III) bromide scintillator, coupled to a digital data acquisition system. The acquisition was synchronized to the cyclotron radio frequency to separate the prompt gamma-ray signals from the later-arriving neutron-induced background. We designed the detector to provide a high energy resolution and an effective reduction of background events, enabling discrete proton-induced prompt gamma lines to be resolved. Measuring discrete prompt gamma lines has several benefits for range verification. As the discrete energies correspond to specific nuclear transitions, the magnitudes of the different gamma lines have unique correlations with the proton energy and can be directly related to nuclear reaction cross sections. The quantification of discrete gamma lines also enables elemental analysis of tissue in the beam path, providing a better prediction of prompt gamma-ray yields. We present the results of experiments in which a water phantom was irradiated with proton pencil-beams in a clinical proton therapy gantry. A slit collimator was used to collimate the prompt gamma-rays, and measurements were performed at 27 positions along the path of proton beams with ranges of 9, 16 and 23 g cm −2 in water. The magnitudes of discrete gamma lines at 4.44, 5.2 and 6.13 MeV were quantified. The prompt gamma lines were found to be clearly resolved in dimensions of energy and time, and had a reproducible correlation with the proton depth-dose curve. We conclude that the measurement of discrete prompt gamma-rays for in vivo range verification of clinical proton beams is feasible, and plan to further study methods and detector designs for clinical use.},

	abstract = {In the context of ion beam therapy, particle range verification is a major challenge for the quality assurance of the treatment. One approach is the measurement of the prompt gamma rays resulting from the tissue irradiation. A Compton camera based on several position sensitive gamma ray detectors, together with an imaging algorithm, is expected to reconstruct the prompt gamma ray emission density map, which is correlated with the dose distribution. At OncoRay and Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), a Compton camera setup is being developed consisting of two scatter planes: two CdZnTe (CZT) cross strip detectors, and an absorber consisting of one Lu 2 SiO 5 (LSO) block detector. The data acquisition is based on VME electronics and handled by software developed on the ROOT framework. The setup has been tested at the linear electron accelerator ELBE at HZDR, which is used in this experiment to produce bunched bremsstrahlung photons with up to 12.5 MeV energy and a repetition rate of 13 MHz. Their spectrum has similarities with the shape expected from prompt gamma rays in the clinical environment, and the flux is also bunched with the accelerator frequency. The charge sharing effect of the CZT detector is studied qualitatively for different energy ranges. The LSO detector pixel discrimination resolution is analyzed and it shows a trend to improve for high energy depositions. The time correlation between the pulsed prompt photons and the measured detector signals, to be used for background suppression, exhibits a time resolution of 3 ns FWHM for the CZT detector and of 2 ns for the LSO detector. A time walk correction and pixel-wise calibration is applied for the LSO detector, whose resolution improves up to 630 ps. In conclusion, the detector setup is suitable for time-resolved background suppression in pulsed clinical particle accelerators. Ongoing tasks are the quantitative comparison with simulations and the test of imaging algorithms. Experiments at proton accelerators have also been performed and are currently under analysis.},

The validity of a stoichiometric method to create the calibration curve has been verified by measuring pairs of Hounsfield units and stopping power values for animal tissue samples. It was found that the agreement between measurement and calibration curve is better than 1\% if beam hardening effects in the acquisition of the CT images can be neglected. The influence of beam hardening effects on the quantitative reading of the CT measurements is discussed and an estimation for the overall range precision of proton beams is given. It is expected that the range of protons in the human body can be controlled to better than +/-1.1\% of the water equivalent range in soft tissue and +/-1.8\% in bone, which translates into a range precision of about 1-3 mm in typical treatment situations.},

Here, we investigate the production of Cerenkov light during proton therapy and its potential applications in proton therapy. A primary proton beam does not have sufficient energy to generate Cerenkov emissions directly, but we have demonstrated two mechanisms by which such emissions may occur indirectly: (1) a fast component from fast electrons liberated by prompt gamma (99.13\%) and neutron (0.87\%) emission; and (2) a slow component from the decay of radioactive positron emitters. The fast component is linear with dose and doserate but carries little spatial information; the slow component is non-linear but may be localised. The properties of the two types of emission are explored using Monte Carlo modelling in GEANT4 with some experimental verification. We propose that Cerenkov emissions could contribute to the visual sensation reported by some patients undergoing proton therapy of the eye and we discuss the feasibility of some potential applications of Cerenkov imaging in proton therapy.},

	abstract = {Treatments delivered by proton therapy are affected by uncertainties on the range of the beam within the patient, requiring medical physicists to add safety margins on the penetration depth of the beam. To reduce these margins and deliver safer treatments, different projects are currently investigating real-time range control by imaging prompt gammas emitted along the proton tracks in the patient. This study reports on the feasibility, development and test of a new concept of prompt gamma camera using a slit collimator to obtain a one-dimensional projection of the beam path on a scintillation detector. This concept was optimized, using the Monte Carlo code MCNPX version 2.5.0, to select high energy photons correlated with the beam range and detect them with both high statistics and sufficient spatial resolution. To validate the Monte Carlo model, spectrometry measurements of secondary particles emitted by a PMMA target during proton irradiation at 160 MeV were realized. An excellent agreement with the simulations was observed when using subtraction methods to isolate the gammas in direct incidence. A first prototype slit camera using the HiCam gamma detector was consequently prepared and tested successfully at 100 and 160 MeV beam energies. Results confirmed the potential of this concept for real-time range monitoring with millimetre accuracy in pencil beam scanning mode for typical clinical conditions. If we neglect electronic dead times and rejection of detected events, the current solution with its collimator at 15 cm from the beam axis can achieve a 1-2 mm standard deviation on range estimation in a homogeneous PMMA target for numbers of protons that correspond to doses in water at the Bragg peak as low as 15 cGy at 100 MeV and 25 cGy at 160 MeV assuming pencil beams with a Gaussian profile of 5 mm sigma at target entrance.},

	abstract = {We have developed the Electron tracking Compton Camera (ETCC) with reconstructing the 3-D tracks of the scattered electron in Compton process for both gamma-ray astronomy and medical imaging [1–3]. By measuring both the directions and energies of a recoil gamma ray and a scattered electron, the direction of the incident gamma ray is determined for an individual photon. Furthermore, a residual measured angle between the recoil electron and scattered gamma ray is powerful for the kinematical background-rejection. For the 3-D tracking of the electrons, the Micro Time Projection Chamber (μ-TPC) was developed, which consists of a new type of the micro pattern gas detector, or a Micro Pixel Gas Chamber (μ-PIC). The ETCC consists of this μ-TPC and the GSO crystal pixel arrays below the μ̃TPC for detecting the recoil gamma rays. The ETCC provided the gamma ray images of point sources between 120keV and ∼1 MeV with the angular resolution of 6 degree (FWHM) at 511keV of 18F ion, respectively. Also the angle of the scattered electron was measured with the resolution of ∼80 degree. Two mobile ETCCs with 10cm-cube TPC for small animal and 30cm-cube TPC for human body, are now being operated for Medical Imaging test. We have studied the imaging performances using both phantoms and small animals (rats and mice) for conventional radioisotopes of 131I and 18F-FDG. In particular, new ETCC with LaBr3 pixel scintillator provides good images similar to SPECT for 131I and human PET for 511keV, respectively, where a clear concentration to tumors in a mouse is observed The 30cm-cube ETCC can get an image for 1m-size length objects in one measurement. Thus, we have carried out several comparisons of our images with those of SPECT and PET. Multi-tracer image using I-131 and FDG for small animal and the image for higher energy gamma ray above 511keV for plants using 54Mn have been carried out successfully. Also several new biomarkers and new radio nuclides were examined to verify the merits of ETCC for medical imaging.},

	abstract = {A proposed Compton camera prototype based on pixelated CdTe is simulated and evaluated in order to establish its feasibility and expected performance in real laboratory tests. The system is based on module units containing a 2×4 array of square CdTe detectors of 10×10 mm2 area and 2 mm thickness. The detectors are pixelated and stacked forming a 3D detector with voxel sizes of 2 × 1 × 2 mm3. The camera performance is simulated with Geant4-based Architecture for Medicine-Oriented Simulations(GAMOS) and the Origin Ensemble(OE) algorithm is used for the image reconstruction. The simulation shows that the camera can operate with up to 104 Bq source activities with equal efficiency and is completely saturated at 109 Bq. The efficiency of the system is evaluated using a simulated 18F point source phantom in the center of the Field-of-View (FOV) achieving an intrinsic efficiency of 0.4 counts per second per kilobecquerel. The spatial resolution measured from the point spread function (PSF) shows a FWHM of 1.5 mm along the direction perpendicular to the scatterer, making it possible to distinguish two points at 3 mm separation with a peak-to-valley ratio of 8.},

	abstract = {Conformal proton radiation therapy requires accurate prediction of the Bragg peak position. Protons may be more suitable than conventional x-rays for this task since the relative electron density distribution can be measured directly with proton computed tomography (CT). However, proton CT has its own limitations, which need to be carefully studied before this technique can be introduced into routine clinical practice. In this work, we have used analytical relationships as well as the Monte Carlo simulation tool GEANT4 to study the principal resolution limits of proton CT. The noise level observed in proton CT images of a cylindrical water phantom with embedded tissue-equivalent density inhomogeneities, which were generated based on GEANT4 simulations, compared well with predictions based on Tschalar's theory of energy loss straggling. The relationship between phantom thickness, initial energy, and the relative electron density resolution was systematically investigated to estimate the proton dose needed to obtain a given density resolution. We show that a reasonable density resolution can be achieved with a relatively small dose, which is comparable to or even lower than that of x-ray CT.},

	doi = {10.1088/0031-9155/59/18/5399},
	abstract = {Proton and ion beams open up new vistas for the curative treatment of tumors, but adequate technologies for monitoring the compliance of dose delivery with treatment plans in real time are still missing. Range assessment, meaning the monitoring of therapy-particle ranges in tissue during dose delivery (treatment), is a continuous challenge considered a key for tapping the full potential of particle therapies. In this context the paper introduces an unconventional concept of range assessment by prompt-gamma timing (PGT), which is based on an elementary physical effect not considered so far: therapy particles penetrating tissue move very fast, but still need a finite transit time--about 1-2 ns in case of protons with a 5-20 cm range--from entering the patient's body until stopping in the target volume. The transit time increases with the particle range. This causes measurable effects in PGT spectra, usable for range verification. The concept was verified by proton irradiation experiments at the AGOR cyclotron, KVI-CART, University of Groningen. Based on the presented kinematical relations, we describe model calculations that very precisely reproduce the experimental results. As the clinical treatment conditions entail measurement constraints (e.g. limited treatment time), we propose a setup, based on clinical irradiation conditions, capable of determining proton range deviations within a few seconds of irradiation, thus allowing for a fast safety survey. Range variations of 2 mm are expected to be clearly detectable.},

	title = {Relative biological effectiveness ({RBE}) values for proton beam therapy},
	volume = {53},
	issn = {0360-3016},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Clinical proton beam therapy has been based on the use of a generic relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.0 or 1.1, since the available evidence has been interpreted as indicating that the magnitude of RBE variation with treatment parameters is small relative to our abilities to determine RBEs. As substantial clinical experience and additional experimental determinations of RBE have accumulated and the number of proton radiation therapy centers is projected to increase, it is appropriate to reassess the rationale for the continued use of a generic RBE and for that RBE to be 1.0-1.1.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Results of experimental determinations of RBE of in vitro and in vivo systems are examined, and then several of the considerations critical to a decision to move from a generic to tissue-, dose/fraction-, and LET-specific RBE values are assessed. The impact of an error in the value assigned to RBE on normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) is discussed. The incidence of major morbidity in proton-treated patients at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) for malignant tumors of the skull base and of the prostate is reviewed. This is followed by an analysis of the magnitude of the experimental effort to exclude an error in RBE of {\textgreater}or=10\% using in vivo systems.
RESULTS: The published RBE values, using colony formation as the measure of cell survival, from in vitro studies indicate a substantial spread between the diverse cell lines. The average value at mid SOBP (Spread Out Bragg Peak) over all dose levels is approximately 1.2, ranging from 0.9 to 2.1. The average RBE value at mid SOBP in vivo is approximately 1.1, ranging from 0.7 to 1.6. Overall, both in vitro and in vivo data indicate a statistically significant increase in RBE for lower doses per fraction, which is much smaller for in vivo systems. There is agreement that there is a measurable increase in RBE over the terminal few millimeters of the SOBP, which results in an extension of the bioeffective range of the beam in the range of 1-2 mm. There is no published report to indicate that the RBE of 1.1 is low. However, a substantial proportion of patients treated at approximately 2 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE)/fraction 5 or more years ago were treated by a combination of both proton and photon beams. Were the RBE to be erroneously underestimated by approximately 10\%, the increase in complication frequency would be quite serious were the complication incidence for the reference treatment {\textgreater}or=3\% and the slope of the dose response curves steep, e.g., a gamma(50) approximately 4. To exclude {\textgreater}or=1.2 as the correct RBE for a specific condition or tissue at the 95\% confidence limit would require relatively large and multiple assays.
CONCLUSIONS: At present, there is too much uncertainty in the RBE value for any human tissue to propose RBE values specific for tissue, dose/fraction, proton energy, etc. The experimental in vivo and clinical data indicate that continued employment of a generic RBE value and for that value to be 1.1 is reasonable. However, there is a local "hot region" over the terminal few millimeters of the SOBP and an extension of the biologically effective range. This needs to be considered in treatment planning, particularly for single field plans or for an end of range in or close to a critical structure. There is a clear need for prospective assessments of normal tissue reactions in proton irradiated patients and determinations of RBE values for several late responding tissues in laboratory animal systems, especially as a function of dose/fraction in the range of 1-4 Gy.},

The purpose of this study was (1) to develop an optimal three-stage Compton camera specifically designed to measure prompt gamma rays emitted from tissue and (2) to determine the feasibility of using this optimized Compton camera design to measure and image prompt gamma rays emitted during proton beam irradiation. The three-stage Compton camera was modeled in Geant4 as three high-purity germanium detector stages arranged in parallel-plane geometry. Initially, an isotropic gamma source ranging from 0 to 15 MeV was used to determine lateral width and thickness of the detector stages that provided the optimal detection efficiency. Then, the gamma source was replaced by a proton beam irradiating a tissue phantom to calculate the overall efficiency of the optimized camera for detecting emitted prompt gammas. The overall calculated efficiencies varied from ∼ 10(-6) to 10(-3) prompt gammas detected per proton incident on the tissue phantom for several variations of the optimal camera design studied. Based on the overall efficiency results, we believe it feasible that a three-stage Compton camera could detect a sufficient number of prompt gammas to allow measurement and imaging of prompt gamma emission during proton radiotherapy.},

	abstract = {Monte Carlo simulations are nowadays essential tools for a wide range of research topics in the field of radiotherapy. They also play an important role in the effort to develop a real-time monitoring system for quality assurance in proton and carbon ion therapy, by means of prompt-gamma detection. The internal theoretical nuclear models of Monte Carlo simulation toolkits are of decisive importance for the accurate description of neutral or charged particle emission, produced by nuclear interactions between beam particles and target nuclei. We assess the performance of Geant4 nuclear models in the context of prompt-gamma emission, comparing them with experimental data from proton and carbon ion beams. As has been shown in the past and further indicated in our study, the prompt-gamma yields are consistently overestimated by Geant4 by a factor of about 100\% to 200\% over an energy range from 80 to 310 MeV/u for the case of (12)C, and to a lesser extent for 160 MeV protons. Furthermore, we focus on the quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) modeling of ion-ion collisions, in order to optimize its description of light nuclei, which are abundant in the human body and mainly anticipated in hadrontherapy applications. The optimization has been performed by benchmarking QMD free parameters with well established nuclear properties. In addition, we study the effect of this optimization on charged particle emission. With the usage of the proposed parameter values, discrepancies reduce to less than 70\%, with the highest values being attributed to the nucleon-ion induced prompt-gammas. This conclusion, also confirmed by the disagreement we observe in the case of proton beams, indicates the need for further investigation on nuclear models which describe proton and neutron induced nuclear reactions.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the feasibility of using the stochastic origin ensemble (SOE) algorithm for reconstructing images of secondary gammas emitted during proton radiotherapy from data measured with a three-stage Compton camera. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of the images of the gamma rays emitted during proton irradiation produced using the SOE algorithm and to measure how well the images reproduce the distal falloff of the beam. For our evaluation, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation of an ideal three-stage Compton camera positioned above and orthogonal to a proton pencil beam irradiating a tissue phantom. Scattering of beam protons with nuclei in the phantom produces secondary gamma rays, which are detected by the Compton camera and used as input to the SOE algorithm. We studied the SOE reconstructed images as a function of the number of iterations, the voxel probability parameter, and the number of detected gammas used by the SOE algorithm. We quantitatively evaluated the capabilities of the SOE algorithm by calculating and comparing the normalized mean square error (NMSE) of SOE reconstructed images. We also studied the ability of the SOE reconstructed images to predict the distal falloff of the secondary gamma production in the irradiated tissue. Our results show that the images produced with the SOE algorithm converge in {\textasciitilde}10,000 iterations, with little improvement to the image NMSE for iterations above this number. We found that the statistical noise of the images is inversely proportional to the ratio of the number of gammas detected to the SOE voxel probability parameter value. In our study, the SOE predicted distal falloff of the reconstructed images agrees with the Monte Carlo calculated distal falloff of the gamma emission profile in the phantom to within ±0.6 mm for the positions of maximum emission (100\%) and 90\%, 50\% and 20\% distal falloff of the gamma emission profile. We conclude that the SOE algorithm is an effective method for reconstructing images of a proton pencil beam from the data collected by an ideal Compton camera and that these images accurately model the distal falloff of secondary gamma emission during proton irradiation.},

Monte Carlo simulations were performed for mono-energetic proton beams, ranging from 2.5 MeV to 250 MeV, irradiating elemental and tissue targets. Calculations of the emission spectra from different biological tissues and their elemental components were made. Also, prompt gamma rays emitted during delivery of a clinical proton spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) in a homogeneous water phantom and a water phantom containing heterogeneous tissue inserts were calculated to study the correlation between prompt gamma-ray production and proton dose delivery. The results show that the prompt gamma-ray spectra differ significantly for each type of tissue studied. The relative intensity of the characteristic gamma rays emitted from a given tissue was shown to be proportional to the concentration of each element in that tissue. A strong correlation was found between the delivered SOBP dose distribution and the characteristic prompt gamma-ray production. Based on these results, we discuss the potential use of prompt gamma-ray emission as a method to verify the accuracy and efficacy of doses delivered with proton radiotherapy.},

@article{Hilaire:2016aa,
	Abstract = {In proton therapy, the prompt-gamma (PG) radiation produced by the interactions between protons and matter is related to the range of the beam in the patient. Tomographic Compton imaging is currently studied to establish a PG image and verify the treatment. However the quality of the reconstructed images depends on a number of factors such as the volume attenuation, the spatial and energy resolutions of the detectors, incomplete absorptions of high energy photons and noise from other particles reaching the camera. The impact of all these factors was not assessed in details. In this paper we investigate the influence of the PG energy spectrum on the reconstructed images. To this aim, we describe the process from the Monte Carlo simulation of the proton irradiation, through the Compton imaging of the PG distribution, up to the image reconstruction with a statistical MLEM method. We identify specific PG energy windows that are more relevant to detect discrepancies with the treatment plan. We find that for the simulated Compton device, the incomplete absorption of the photons with energy above about 2 MeV prevents the observation of the PG distributions at specific energies. It also leads to blurred images and smooths the distal slope of the 1D PG profiles obtained as projections on the central beam axis. We show that a selection of the events produced by gamma photons having deposited almost all their energy in the camera allows to largely improve the images, a result that emphasizes the importance of the choice of the detector. However, this initial-energy-based selection is not accessible in practice. We then propose a method to estimate the range of the PG profile both for specific deposited-energy windows and for the full spectrum emission. The method relies on two parameters. We use a learning approach for their estimation and we show that it allows to detect few millimeter shifts of the PG profiles.},

@article{Ortega:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Compton Cameras emerged as an alternative for real-time dose monitoring techniques for Particle Therapy (PT), based on the detection of prompt-gammas. As a consequence of the Compton scattering process, the gamma origin point can be restricted onto the surface of a cone (Compton cone). Through image reconstruction techniques, the distribution of the gamma emitters can be estimated, using cone-surfaces backprojections of the Compton cones through the image space, along with more sophisticated statistical methods to improve the image quality. To calculate the Compton cone required for image reconstruction, either two interactions, the last being photoelectric absorption, or three scatter interactions are needed. Because of the high energy of the photons in PT the first option might not be adequate, as the photon is not absorbed in general. However, the second option is less efficient. That is the reason to resort to spectral reconstructions, where the incoming gamma energy is considered as a variable in the reconstruction inverse problem. Jointly with prompt gamma, secondary neutrons and scattered photons, not strongly correlated with the dose map, can also reach the imaging detector and produce false events. These events deteriorate the image quality. Also, high intensity beams can produce particle accumulation in the camera, which lead to an increase of random coincidences, meaning events which gather measurements from different incoming particles. The noise scenario is expected to be different if double or triple events are used, and consequently, the reconstructed images can be affected differently by spurious data. The aim of the present work is to study the effect of false events in the reconstructed image, evaluating their impact in the determination of the beam particle ranges. A simulation study that includes misidentified events (neutrons and random coincidences) in the final image of a Compton Telescope for PT monitoring is presented. The complete chain of detection, from the beam particle entering a phantom to the event classification, is simulated using FLUKA. The range determination is later estimated from the reconstructed image obtained from a two and three-event algorithm based on Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization. The neutron background and random coincidences due to a therapeutic-like time structure are analyzed for mono-energetic proton beams. The time structure of the beam is included in the simulations, which will affect the rate of particles entering the detector.},

Each channel of the ASIC consists of one input current conveyor driving separately a current comparator for signal event detection and a charge-sensitive amplifier (CSA) for signal charge measurement. The ASIC has brought significant improvements compared to its previous version: larger input dynamic range (53 dB against 33 dB), lower power consumption (11 mW/channel instead of 22 mW/channel under a 3.3-V supply), lower noise (4 fC versus 19 fC in Equivalent input Noise Charge, or ENC) and a better phase margin for optimizing stability and speed. This dedicated chip had been used in a beam test at HIT (Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center). System testing has shown achievements of 1 mm spatial resolution (size of the scintillating fibers) and a 4 MHz count rate. The main limitation comes from the Ma-PMTs which saturates at such a frequency. The ASIC operates normally with satisfied performances.},

This camera has a potential of developing the new reagents. We have carried out several imaging reagent studies as examples; (1) 18F-FDG and 131I-MIBG simultaneous imaging for double clinical tracer imaging, (2) imaging of some minerals (Mn-54, Zn-65, Fe-59) in mouse and plants. In addition, ETCC has a potential of real-time monitoring of the Bragg peak location by imaging prompt gamma rays for the beam therapy. We carried out the water phantom experiment using 140MeV proton beam, and obtained the images of both 511 keV and high energy gamma rays (800-2,000keV). Here better correlation of the latter image to the Bragg peak has been observed. Another potential of ETCC is to reconstruct the 3D image using only one-head camera without rotations of both the target and camera. Good 3D images of the thyroid grant phantom and the mouse with tumor were observed. In order to advance those features to the practical use, we are improving the all components and then construct the multi-head ETCC system.},

This set of data is directly passed to the beam delivery and control system. The treatment planning code has been in clinical use since the start of the GSI pilot project in December 1997.

	volume = {34},
	issn = {0094-2405},
	abstract = {The Monte Carlo method provides the most accurate dose calculations on a patient computed tomography (CT) geometry. The increase in accuracy is, at least in part, due to the fact that instead of treating human tissues as water of various densities as in analytical algorithms, the Monte Carlo method allows human tissues to be characterized by elemental composition and mass density, and hence allows the accurate consideration of all relevant electromagnetic and nuclear interactions. On the other hand, the algorithm to convert CT Hounsfield numbers to tissue materials for Monte Carlo dose calculation introduces uncertainties. There is not a simple one to one correspondence between Hounsfield numbers and tissue materials. To investigate the effects of Hounsfield number conversion for proton Monte Carlo dose calculations, clinical proton treatment plans were simulated using the Geant4 Monte Carlo code. Three Hounsfield number to material conversion methods were studied. The results were compared in forms of dose volume histograms of gross tumor volume and clinical target volume. The differences found are generally small but can be dosimetrically significant. Further, different methods may cause deviations in the predicted proton beam range in particular for deep proton fields. Typically, slight discrepancies in mass density assignments play only a minor role in the target region, whereas more significant effects are caused by different assignments in elemental compositions. In the presence of large tissue inhomogeneities, for head and neck treatments, treatment planning decisions could be affected by these differences because of deviations in the predicted tumor coverage. Outside the target area, differences in elemental composition and mass density assignments both may play a role. This can lead to pronounced effects for organs at risk, in particular in the spread-out Bragg peak penumbra or distal regions. In addition, the significance of the elemental composition effect (dose to water vs. dose to tissue) is tissue-type dependent and is also affected by nuclear reactions.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To verify the usefulness of our developed beam ON-LINE positron emission tomography (PET) system mounted on a rotating gantry port (BOLPs-RGp) for dose-volume delivery-guided proton therapy (DGPT).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: In the proton treatment room at our facility, a BOLPs-RGp was constructed so that a planar PET apparatus could be mounted with its field of view covering the iso-center of the beam irradiation system. Activity measurements were performed in 48 patients with tumors of the head and neck, liver, lungs, prostate, and brain. The position and intensity of the activity were measured using the BOLPs-RGp during the 200 s immediately after the proton irradiation.
RESULTS: The daily measured activity images acquired by the BOLPs-RGp showed the proton irradiation volume in each patient. Changes in the proton-irradiated volume were indicated by differences between a reference activity image (taken at the first treatment) and the daily activity-images. In the case of head-and-neck treatment, the activity distribution changed in the areas where partial tumor reduction was observed. In the case of liver treatment, it was observed that the washout effect in necrotic tumor cells was slower than in non-necrotic tumor cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The BOLPs-RGp was developed for the DGPT. The accuracy of proton treatment was evaluated by measuring changes of daily measured activity. Information about the positron-emitting nuclei generated during proton irradiation can be used as a basis for ensuring the high accuracy of irradiation in proton treatment.},

A major challenge in collimated PG imaging is the suppression of neutron-induced background counts. In this work, we present an initial performance test of two knife-edge slit camera prototypes based on arrays of digital photon counters (DPCs). PG profiles emitted from a PMMA target upon irradiation with a 160 MeV proton pencil beams (about 6.5 × 10 9 protons delivered in total) were measured using detector modules equipped with four DPC arrays coupled to BGO or LYSO : Ce crystal matrices. The knife-edge slit collimator and detector module were placed at 15 cm and 30 cm from the beam axis, respectively, in all cases. The use of LYSO : Ce enabled time-of-flight (TOF) rejection of background events, by synchronizing the DPC readout electronics with the 106 MHz radiofrequency signal of the cyclotron. The signal-to-background (S/B) ratio of 1.6 obtained with a 1.5 ns TOF window and a 3 MeV–7 MeV energy window was about 3 times higher than that obtained with the same detector module without TOF discrimination and 2 times higher than the S/B ratio obtained with the BGO module. Even 1 mm shifts of the Bragg peak position translated into clear and consistent shifts of the PG profile if TOF discrimination was applied, for a total number of protons as low as about 6.5 × 10 8 and a detector surface of 6.6 cm × 6.6 cm.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a silicon (Si) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) imaging Compton camera for biomedical application on the basis of technologies used for astrophysical observation and to test its capacity to perform three-dimensional (3D) imaging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All animal experiments were performed according to the Animal Care and Experimentation Committee (Gunma University, Maebashi, Japan). Flourine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), iodine 131 ((131)I) methylnorcholestenol, and gallium 67 ((67)Ga) citrate, separately compacted into micro tubes, were inserted subcutaneously into a Wistar rat, and the distribution of the radioisotope compounds was determined with 3D imaging by using the Compton camera after the rat was sacrificed (ex vivo model). In a separate experiment, indium 111((111)In) chloride and (131)I-methylnorcholestenol were injected into a rat intravenously, and copper 64 ((64)Cu) chloride was administered into the stomach orally just before imaging. The isotope distributions were determined with 3D imaging after sacrifice by means of the list-mode-expectation-maximizing-maximum-likelihood method.
RESULTS: The Si/CdTe Compton camera demonstrated its 3D multinuclear imaging capability by separating out the distributions of FDG, (131)I-methylnorcholestenol, and (67)Ga-citrate clearly in a test-tube-implanted ex vivo model. In the more physiologic model with tail vein injection prior to sacrifice, the distributions of (131)I-methylnorcholestenol and (64)Cu-chloride were demonstrated with 3D imaging, and the difference in distribution of the two isotopes was successfully imaged although the accumulation on the image of (111)In-chloride was difficult to visualize because of blurring at the low-energy region.
CONCLUSION: The Si/CdTe Compton camera clearly resolved the distribution of multiple isotopes in 3D imaging and simultaneously in the ex vivo model.},

	abstract = {Hadron therapy allows for highly conformal dose distributions and better sparing of organs-at-risk, thanks to the characteristic dose deposition as function of depth. However, the quality of hadron therapy treatments is closely connected with the ability to predict and achieve a given beam range in the patient. Currently, uncertainties in particle range lead to the employment of safety margins, at the expense of treatment quality. Much research in particle therapy is therefore aimed at developing methods to verify the particle range in patients. Non-invasive in vivo monitoring of the particle range can be performed by detecting secondary radiation, emitted from the patient as a result of nuclear interactions of charged hadrons with tissue, including β+ emitters, prompt photons, and charged fragments. The correctness of the dose delivery can be verified by comparing measured and pre-calculated distributions of the secondary particles. The reliability of Monte Carlo (MC) predictions is a key issue. Correctly modeling the production of secondaries is a non-trivial task, because it involves nuclear physics interactions at energies, where no rigorous theories exist to describe them. The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of various aspects in modeling the physics processes for range verification with secondary particles produced in proton, carbon, and heavier ion irradiation. We discuss electromagnetic and nuclear interactions of charged hadrons in matter, which is followed by a summary of some widely used MC codes in hadron therapy. Then, we describe selected examples of how these codes have been validated and used in three range verification techniques: PET, prompt gamma, and charged particle detection. We include research studies and clinically applied methods. For each of the techniques, we point out advantages and disadvantages, as well as clinical challenges still to be addressed, focusing on MC simulation aspects.},

METHODS: Proton therapy using a beam on-line PET system mounted on a rotating gantry port (BOLPs-RGp), which the authors developed, is provided at the National Cancer Center Kashiwa, Japan. BOLPs-RGp is a monitoring system that can confirm the activity distribution of the proton irradiated volume by detection of a pair of annihilation gamma rays coincidentally from positron emitter nuclei generated by the target nuclear fragment reactions between irradiated proton nuclei and nuclei in the human body. Activity is measured from a start of proton irradiation to a period of 200 s after the end of the irradiation. The characteristics of the positron emitter nuclei generated in a patient's body were verified by the measurement of the activity distribution at each treatment site using BOLPs-RGp.
RESULTS: The decay curves for measured activity were able to be approximated using two or three half-life values regardless of the treatment site. The activity of half-life value of about 2 min was important for a confirmation of the proton irradiated volume.
CONCLUSIONS: In each proton treatment site, verification of the characteristics of the generated positron emitter nuclei was performed by using BOLPs-RGp. For the monitoring of the proton irradiated volume, the detection of (15)O generated in a human body was important.},

	abstract = {The increased biological effectiveness of heavy charged particle beams like e.g., carbon ions in the tumor volume in comparison to the lower effectiveness in the surrounding healthy tissue represents one of the major rationales for their application in tumor therapy. This increased effectiveness also characterizes the advantage of heavier ions compared to proton beams. The increased effectiveness has to be taken into account in treatment planning in order to estimate the corresponding photon equivalent doses in normal and tumor tissues, thus allowing a link e.g., to normal tissue dose limits in conventional photon therapy. Due to the complex dependencies of RBE on parameters like dose, beam energy, LET, atomic number and cell or tissue type, the relevant RBEs cannot be solely determined from experimental data. Therefore, within the framework of the pilot project of tumor therapy with carbon ions performed at GSI Darmstadt, treatment planning is based on a biophysical model, which has been extensively tested. The paper first summarizes the essential systematic dependencies of RBE on different parameters like e.g., dose, LET, atomic number and cell type. The basic principle of the biophysical model is then introduced, and special emphasis is given to the application of the model to in vivo and clinical endpoints. Model predictions are compared to experimental data in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the implementation of the biophysical model in the treatment planning procedure is presented. The biological verification of the whole treatment planning procedure is explained and examples of patient treatment plans are given.},

	abstract = {Real-time monitoring techniques are receiving increased attention due to their great potential for improving the precision of treatment delivery for hadron-therapy (HT). The study of prompt-γ(PG) focuses on the energetic photon radiation exiting the patient few nanoseconds after the beam irradiation. Its high intensity compared to other similar technologies like in-beam Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and good correlation with the original dose deposition profile are promising features. On the other hand, the use of neutral particles to monitor the dose comes together with a high noise background, mainly due to neutrons and scattered γ, which are uncorrelated with the original dose map. The search of a robust detector that fully exploits the information from PG is still a matter of research. Compton Cameras (CC) have been proposed for PG real-time dose monitoring mainly due to their good time and spatial resolution and their lack of mechanical collimation, which worsen the intrinsic PG high intensity. Conventional CC are based on one or more scatterers and an absorber. The incoming γ direction requires at least two interactions in different layers, assuming the γ energy is known. However, the broad PG energy spectrum in HT makes it impossible to know in advance the energy of the γ. Therefore, three interactions are more suitable to determine the γ Compton cone. Nevertheless, two interactions can be still used, if the incoming energy is included as a part of the reconstruction inverse problem (4D spectral reconstruction). The noise scenario is thus different depending if two or three interactions are employed. For that reason, the expected reconstructed image can be affected differently by spurious data, such as random coincidences and pile-up in the detector from high intensity beams. In this work, a Monte Carlo (MC) based study is carried out with the aim of evaluating the impact of different noise sources (neutro- s, random coincidences and pile-up) for range determination. The complete chain of detection, from the beam particle impinging on a phantom to the event reconstruction, is simulated using FLUKA. The range location is later estimated from the reconstructed image obtained from a 2 and 3 interaction algorithm based on Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM).},

	abstract = {The formula of the pseudo-Voigt function expressed by a weighted sum of Gaussian and Lorentzian functions is extended by adding two other types of peak functions in order to improve the accuracy when approximating the Voigt profile. The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) values and mixing parameters of the Gaussian, the Lorentzian and the other two component functions in the extended formula can be approximated by polynomials of a parameter ρ = ΓL/(ΓG + ΓL), where ΓG and ΓL are the FWHM values of the deconvoluted Gaussian and Lorentzian functions, respectively. The maximum deviation of the extended pseudo-Voigt function from the Voigt profile is within 0.12\% relative to the peak height when sixth-order polynomial expansions are used. The systematic errors of the integrated intensity ΓG and ΓL, estimated by fitting the extended formula to Voigt profiles, are typically less than 1/10 of the errors arising from the application of the original formula of the pseudo-Voigt approximation proposed by Thompson et al. [J. Appl. Cryst. (1987), 20, 79–83], while the time required for computation of the extended formula is only about 2.5 relative to the computation time required for the original formula.},

	abstract = {The application of the Rietveld refinement technique to synchrotron X-ray data collected from a capillary sample of Al2O3 in Debye–Scherrer geometry is described. The data were obtained at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) with an Si(111) double-crystal monochromator and a Ge(111) crystal analyzer. Fits to a number of well resolved individual peaks demonstrate that the peak shapes are very well described by the pseudo-Voigt function, which is a simple approximation to the convolution of Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. The variation of the Gaussian and Lorentzian half widths, ΓG and ΓL, with Bragg angle can be approximated quite closely by the functions V tan θ and X/cos θ which represent the contributions from instrumental resolution and particle-size broadening respectively. Rietveld refinement based on this model yields generally satisfactory results. The refined values of V and X are consistent with the expected vertical divergence (≃0.1 mrad) and the nominal particle size (≃ 0.3μm). In particular, the use of a capillary specimen virtually eliminates preferred orientation effects, which are highly significant in flat-plate samples of this material.},

This application is mainly on the detection and visualization of the pharmacokinetics of tumor targeting substances specific for particular cancer sites. Expected high resolution ({\textless} 0.5 mm) permits monitoring the pharmacokinetics of labeled gene constructs in vivo in small animals with a human tumor xenograft which is one of the first steps in evaluating the potential utility of a candidate gene. The additional benefit of high sensitivity detection will be improved cancer treatment strategies in patients based on the use of specific molecules binding to cancer sites for early detection of tumors and identifying metastasis, monitoring drug delivery and radionuclide therapy for optimum cell killing at the tumor site. This new technology can provide high resolution, high sensitivity imaging of a wide range of gamma energies and will significantly extend the range of radiotracers that can be investigated and used clinically. The small and compact construction of the proposed camera system allows flexible application which will be particularly useful for monitoring residual tumor around the resection site during surgery. It is also envisaged as able to test the performance of new drug/gene-based therapies in vitro and in vivo for tumor targeting efficacy using automatic large scale screening methods.},

Within the scope of this review, published data with respect to motion management in scattered as well as scanned beam treatment delivery will be summarized. Based on a section covering the dosimetric impact of organ motion, motion management during treatment planning, patient positioning, treatment delivery and treatment validation will be summarized. For scattered beam delivery, the concepts and data are often based on clinical usage since treatment of moving tumors has been performed for several years. In the field of scanned beam delivery, the report focuses on the results of research on countermeasures of the interference effect. Clinical application of these techniques can be expected in the near future.},

	abstract = {Radiotherapy with narrow scanned carbon ion beams enables a highly accurate treatment of tumours while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. Changes in the patient’s geometry can alter the actual ion range in tissue and result in unfavourable changes in the dose distribution. Consequently, it is desired to verify the actual beam delivery within the patient. Real-time and non-invasive measurement methods are preferable. Currently, the only technically feasible method to monitor the delivered dose distribution within the patient is based on tissue activation measurements by means of positron emission tomography (PET). An alternative monitoring method based on tracking of prompt secondary ions leaving a patient irradiated with carbon ion beams has been previously suggested. It is expected to help in overcoming the limitations of the PET-based technique like physiological washout of the beam induced activity, low signal and to allow for real-time measurements. In this paper, measurements of secondary charged particle tracks around a head-sized homogeneous PMMA phantom irradiated with pencil-like carbon ion beams are presented. The investigated energies and beam widths are within the therapeutically used range. The aim of the study is to deduce properties of the primary beam from the distribution of the secondary charged particles. Experiments were performed at the Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Center, Germany. The directions of secondary charged particles emerging from the PMMA phantom were measured using an arrangement of two parallel pixelated silicon detectors (Timepix). The distribution of the registered particle tracks was analysed to deduce its dependence on clinically important beam parameters: beam range, width and position. Distinct dependencies of the secondary particle tracks on the properties of the primary carbon ion beam were observed. In the particular experimental set-up used, beam range differences of 1.3 mm were detectable. In addition, variations in the beam width could be measured with a precision of 0.9 mm. Furthermore, shifts of the lateral beam position could be monitored with a sub-millimetre precision. The presented investigations demonstrate experimentally that the non-invasive measurement and analysis of secondary ion distributions around head-sized homogeneous objects provide information on the actual beam delivery. Beam range, width and position could be monitored with a precision attractive for therapeutic situations.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the feasibility of using the stochastic origin ensemble (SOE) algorithm for reconstructing images of secondary gammas emitted during proton radiotherapy from data measured with a three-stage Compton camera. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of the images of the gamma rays emitted during proton irradiation produced using the SOE algorithm and to measure how well the images reproduce the distal falloff of the beam. For our evaluation, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation of an ideal three-stage Compton camera positioned above and orthogonal to a proton pencil beam irradiating a tissue phantom. Scattering of beam protons with nuclei in the phantom produces secondary gamma rays, which are detected by the Compton camera and used as input to the SOE algorithm. We studied the SOE reconstructed images as a function of the number of iterations, the voxel probability parameter, and the number of detected gammas used by the SOE algorithm. We quantitatively evaluated the capabilities of the SOE algorithm by calculating and comparing the normalized mean square error (NMSE) of SOE reconstructed images. We also studied the ability of the SOE reconstructed images to predict the distal falloff of the secondary gamma production in the irradiated tissue. Our results show that the images produced with the SOE algorithm converge in ∼10 000 iterations, with little improvement to the image NMSE for iterations above this number. We found that the statistical noise of the images is inversely proportional to the ratio of the number of gammas detected to the SOE voxel probability parameter value. In our study, the SOE predicted distal falloff of the reconstructed images agrees with the Monte Carlo calculated distal falloff of the gamma emission profile in the phantom to within ±0.6 mm for the positions of maximum emission (100\%) and 90\%, 50\% and 20\% distal falloff of the gamma emission profile. We conclude that the SOE algorithm is an effective method for reconstructing images of a proton pencil beam from the data collected by an ideal Compton camera and that these images accurately model the distal falloff of secondary gamma emission during proton irradiation.},

	abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of radioactivity distributions induced by therapeutic irradiation is at present the only feasible method for an in situ and non-invasive monitoring of radiooncology treatments with ion beams. Therefore, at the experimental carbon ion therapy facility at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung Darmstadt, Germany (GSI) a PET scanner has been integrated into the treatment site for quality assurance monitoring simultaneously to the therapeutic irradiation. Although the device has been assembled from components of positron emission tomographs developed for nuclear medicine applications, substantial modifications had to be made for meeting the requirements of ion therapy monitoring. These changes regard the geometrical detector configuration as well as the data acquisition and processing. Since 1997 this technique has been applied to monitor the fractionated irradiation of more than 180 patients predominantly suffering from tumours in the head and neck region. It could be demonstrated that this new PET technique is capable of assessing parameters being relevant for quality assurance of carbon ion therapy, i.e. the particle range in tissue, the position of the irradiated volume with respect to anatomical landmarks and local deviations between the planned and the applied dose distributions.},

	abstract = {Ion beams offer an excellent tumor-dose conformality due to their inverted depth-dose profile and finite range in tissue, the Bragg peak (BP). However, they introduce sensitivity to range uncertainties. Imaging techniques play an increasingly important role in ion beam therapy to support precise diagnosis and identification of the target volume at the planning stage as well as to ensure the correspondence between the planning and treatment situation at the actual irradiation. For the purpose of improved treatment quality, ion-based radiographic images could be acquired at the treatment site before or during treatment and be employed to monitor the patient positioning and to check the patient-specific ion range. This work presents the initial experimental investigations carried out to address the feasibility of carbon ion radiography at the Heidelberg ion therapy center using a prototype range telescope set-up and an active raster scanning ion beam delivery system. Bragg curves are measured with a stack of ionization chambers (IC) synchronously to the beam delivery. The position of the BP is extracted from the data by locating the channel of maximum current signal for each delivered beam. Each BP is associated to the lateral and vertical positions of the scanned raster point extrapolated from the beam monitor system to build up a radiography. The radiographic images are converted into water equivalent thickness (WET) based on two calibrations of the detector. Radiographies of two phantoms of different complexities are reconstructed and their image quality is analyzed. A novel method proposed to increase the nominal range resolution of the IC stack is applied to the carbon ion radiography of an Alderson head phantom. Moreover, an x-ray digitally reconstructed radiography of the same anthropomorphic head phantom is converted in WET through the clinically used ion range calibration curve and compared with the carbon ion radiography based on a γ-index approach, yielding a good correspondence in terms of absolute WET within ±3\%, 3 mm distance-to-agreement and, 87\% passing ratio. Imaging artifacts at interfaces within the irradiated phantom due to the finite size of the beam, resulting in multiple maxima, are addressed. Overall, this work demonstrates the feasibility of the prototype range telescope to acquire ion-based transmission imaging with a resolution of up to 0.8 mm WET.},

	abstract = {A new high-resolution four-layer DOl detector using MPPCs for brain PET scanner has been developed. The new depth of interaction (DOl) detector was designed to compose of four layers of detector units, which were lined up five axially. Each of the detector units consists of a LYSO scintillator array finely segmented of 1.2 mm and an 8 × 8 array of multi-pixel photon counters (MPPCs), which are one of the products of silicon photomultiplier family. The MPPC is so compact and insensitive to gamma-ray that the detector units can be piled up with a small gap between each scintillator array in the depth direction. In order to have the detector in every layer equally sensitive to gamma-ray, the scintillator thickness was designed at 3 mm, 4 mm, 5 mm and 8 mm toward the bottom respectively, and the total thickness was 20 mm. We adopted an internal focused laser processing technique to a monolithic LYSO scintillator and fabricated a 2D segmented array of 32 × 32 with 1.2 mm pitch in 38.4 mm square cross-section. Each detector layer has independently front end circuits including ASICs for MPPCs and signal processing circuits for crystal identification, energy and timing detection. Each data set of four layers are fed into data interface circuits placed behind detector layers and transferred to a data acquisition unit as formatted list-mode data. The performance of the four-layer DOl detector has been evaluated. The coincidence timing resolution of the detector, with a reference BaF2 detector, was obtained 850 ps FWHM. The average energy resolution value was 24.5\% at 511 keV. The crystal separation with finely segmented LYSO scintillator was also good enough at each layer.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The LET position of the RBE maximum and its dependence on the cellular repair capacity was determined for carbon ions. Hamster cell lines of differing repair capacity were irradiated with monoenergetic carbon ions. RBE values for cell inactivation at different survival levels were determined and the differences in the RBE-LET patterns were compared with the individual sensitivity to photon irradiation of the different cell lines.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three hamster cell lines, the wild-type cell lines V79 and CHO-K1 and the radiosensitive CHO mutant xrs5, were irradiated with carbon ions of different energies (2.4-266.4 MeV/u) and LET values (13.7-482.7 keV/microm) and inactivation data were measured in comparison to 250 kV x-rays.
RESULTS: For the repair-proficient cell lines a RBE maximum was found at LET values between 150 and 200 keV/microm. For the repair-deficient cell line the RBE failed to show a maximum and decreased continuously for LET values above 100 keV/microm.
CONCLUSIONS: The carbon RBE LET relationship for inactivation is shifted to higher LET values compared with protons and alpha-particles. RBE correlated with the repair capacity of the cells.},

Such measurement could be realized thanks to a new kind of radio-nuclides which emit a γ-ray quasi-simultaneously with the β+ decay. The most interesting radio-nuclide candidate, namely 44Sc, will be potentially produced at the Nantes cyclotron ARRONAX. The principle is to reconstruct the intersection of the classical line of response (obtained with a standard PET camera) with the direction cone defined by the third γ-ray. The emission angle measurement of this additional γ-ray involves the use of a Compton telescope for which a new generation of camera based on a liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chamber is considered. GEANT3 simulations of a large acceptance LXe Compton telescope combined with a commercial micro-PET (LSO crystals) have been performed and the obtained results will be presented. They demonstrate that a good image can be obtained from the accumulation of each three-dimensional measured position. A spatial resolution of 2.3 mm has been reached with an injected activity of 0.5 MBq for a 44Sc point source emitter.},

This 'γ-PET' technique draws on specific β + -decaying isotopes, simultaneously emitting an additional photon. Exploiting the triple coincidence between the positron annihilation and the third photon, it is possible to separate the reconstructed 'true' events from background. In order to characterize this technique, Monte-Carlo simulations and image reconstructions have been performed. The achievable spatial resolution has been found to reach ca. 0.4 mm (FWHM) in each direction for the visualization of a 22 Na point source. Only 40 intersections are sufficient for a reliable sub-millimeter image reconstruction of a point source embedded in a scattering volume of water inside a voxel volume of about 1 mm 3 ('high-resolution mode'). Moreover, starting with an injected activity of 400 MBq for 76 Br, the same number of only about 40 reconstructed intersections are needed in case of a larger voxel volume of 2 x 2 x 3 mm 3 ('high-sensitivity mode'). Requiring such a low number of reconstructed events significantly reduces the required acquisition time for image reconstruction (in the above case to about 140 s) and thus may open up the perspective for a quasi real-time imaging.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Range verification in ion beam therapy relies to date on nuclear imaging techniques which require complex and costly detector systems. A different approach is the detection of thermoacoustic signals that are generated due to localized energy loss of ion beams in tissue (ionoacoustics). Aim of this work was to study experimentally the achievable position resolution of ionoacoustics under idealized conditions using high frequency ultrasonic transducers and a specifically selected probing beam. Methods: A water phantom was irradiated by a pulsed 20 MeV proton beam with varying pulse intensity and length. The acoustic signal of single proton pulses was measured by different PZT-based ultrasound detectors (3.5 and 10 MHz central frequencies). The proton dose distribution in water was calculated by Geant4 and used as input for simulation of the generated acoustic wave by the matlab toolbox k-WAVE. Results: In measurements from this study, a clear signal of the Bragg peak was observed for an energy deposition as low as 1012 eV. The signal amplitude showed a linear increase with particle number per pulse and thus, dose. Bragg peak position measurements were reproducible within ±30 μm and agreed with Geant4 simulations to better than 100 μm. The ionoacoustic signal pattern allowed for a detailed analysis of the Bragg peak and could be well reproduced by k-WAVE simulations. Conclusions: The authors have studied the ionoacoustic signal of the Bragg peak in experiments using a 20 MeV proton beam with its correspondingly localized energy deposition, demonstrating submillimeter position resolution and providing a deep insight in the correlation between the acoustic signal and Bragg peak shape. These results, together with earlier experiments and new simulations (including the results in this study) at higher energies, suggest ionoacoustics as a technique for range verification in particle therapy at locations, where the tumor can be localized by ultrasound imaging. This acoustic range verification approach could offer the possibility of combining anatomical ultrasound and Bragg peak imaging, but further studies are required for translation of these findings to clinical application.},

The change in momentum of the X-ray quantum due to the change in its direction of propagation results in a recoil of the scattering electron. The energy in the scattered quantum is thus less than the energy in the primary quantum by the kinetic energy of recoil of the scattering electron. The corresponding increase in the wave-length of the scattered beam is λθ−λ0=(2hmc) sin2 12θ=0.0484 sin2 12θ, where h is the Planck constant, m is the mass of the scattering electron, c is the velocity of light, and θ is the angle between the incident and the scattered ray. Hence the increase is independent of the wave-length. The distribution of the scattered radiation is found, by an indirect and not quite rigid method, to be concentrated in the forward direction according to a definite law (Eq. 27). The total energy removed from the primary beam comes out less than that given by the classical Thomson theory in the ratio 1(1+2α), where α=hmcλ0=0.0242λ0. Of this energy a fraction (1+α)(1+2α) reappears as scattered radiation, while the remainder is truly absorbed and transformed into kinetic energy of recoil of the scattering electrons. Hence, if σ0 is the scattering absorption coefficient according to the classical theory, the coefficient according to this theory is σ=σ0(1+2α)=σs+σa, where σs is the true scattering coefficient [(1+α)σ(1+2α)2], and σa is the coefficient of absorption due to scattering [ασ(1+2α)2]. Unpublished experimental results are given which show that for graphite and the Mo-K radiation the scattered radiation is longer than the primary, the observed difference (λπ2−λ0=.022) being close to the computed value.024. In the case of scattered γ-rays, the wave-length has been found to vary with θ in agreement with the theory, increasing from.022 A (primary) to.068 A (θ=135∘). Also the velocity of secondary β-rays excited in light elements by γ-rays agrees with the suggestion that they are recoil electrons. As for the predicted variation of absorption with λ, Hewlett's results for carbon for wave-lengths below 0.5 A are in excellent agreement with this theory; also the predicted concentration in the forward direction is shown to be in agreement with the experimental results, both for X-rays and γ-rays. This remarkable agreement between experiment and theory indicates clearly that scattering is a quantum phenomenon and can be explained without introducing any new hypothesis as to the size of the electron or any new constants; also that a radiation quantum carries with it momentum as well as energy. The restriction to light elements is due to the assumption that the constraining forces acting on the scattering electrons are negligible, which is probably legitimate only for the lighter elements.},

For a plethora of malignancies, current radiotherapy using photons or protons yields marginal benefits in local control and survival. One hypothesis is that these malignancies have acquired, or are inherently radioresistant to low LET radiation. In the last decade, carbon ion radiotherapy facilities have slowly been constructed in Europe and Asia, demonstrating favorable results for many of the malignancies that do poorly with conventional radiotherapy. However, from a radiobiological perspective, much of how this modality works in overcoming radioresistance, and extending local control and survival are not yet fully understood. In this review, we will explain from a radiobiological perspective how carbon ion radiotherapy can overcome the classical and recently postulated contributors of radioresistance (α/β ratio, hypoxia, cell proliferation, the tumor microenvironment and metabolism, and cancer stem cells). Furthermore, we will make recommendations on the important factors to consider, such as anatomical location, in the future design and implementation of clinical trials. With the existing data available we believe that the expansion of carbon ion facilities into the United States is warranted.},

Serial four-dimensional (4D) CT scans were performed under free breathing conditions; the time span between the first and second 4DCT scans was five weeks. We quantified WEL changes between the first and second CT scans due to interfractional changes (tumor shrinkage and tissue density changes) and compared the particle-beam-stopping point between the serial 4DCT scans with use of the same initial bolus. Both tumor-shrinkage and lung-density changes were observed in a single patient over the course of therapy. The lung density decreased by approximately 0.1 g/cm(3) between the first and second-CT scans, resulting in a 1.5 cm WEL changes. Tumor shrinkage resulted in approximately 3 cm WEL changes. If the same initial bolus and plan were used through the treatment course, an unexpected significant beam overshoot would occur by interfractional changes due to tumor shrinkage and lung density variation.},

	abstract = {Prompt gamma rays emitted from biological tissues during proton irradiation carry dosimetric and spectroscopic information that can assist with treatment verification and provide an indication of the biological response of the irradiated tissues. Compton cameras are capable of determining the origin and energy of gamma rays. However, prompt gamma monitoring during proton therapy requires new Compton camera designs that perform well at the high gamma energies produced when tissues are bombarded with therapeutic protons. In this study we optimize the materials and geometry of a three-stage Compton camera for prompt gamma detection and calculate the theoretical efficiency of such a detector. The materials evaluated in this study include germanium, bismuth germanate (BGO), NaI, xenon, silicon and lanthanum bromide (LaBr(3)). For each material, the dimensions of each detector stage were optimized to produce the maximum number of relevant interactions. These results were used to predict the efficiency of various multi-material cameras. The theoretical detection efficiencies of the most promising multi-material cameras were then calculated for the photons emitted from a tissue-equivalent phantom irradiated by therapeutic proton beams ranging from 50 to 250 MeV. The optimized detector stages had a lateral extent of 10 × 10 cm(2) with the thickness of the initial two stages dependent on the detector material. The thickness of the third stage was fixed at 10 cm regardless of material. The most efficient single-material cameras were composed of germanium (3 cm) and BGO (2.5 cm). These cameras exhibited efficiencies of 1.15 × 10(-4) and 9.58 × 10(-5) per incident proton, respectively. The most efficient multi-material camera design consisted of two initial stages of germanium (3 cm) and a final stage of BGO, resulting in a theoretical efficiency of 1.26 × 10(-4) per incident proton.},

The purpose of this study was (1) to develop an optimal three-stage Compton camera specifically designed to measure prompt gamma rays emitted from tissue and (2) to determine the feasibility of using this optimized Compton camera design to measure and image prompt gamma rays emitted during proton beam irradiation. The three-stage Compton camera was modeled in Geant4 as three high-purity germanium detector stages arranged in parallel-plane geometry. Initially, an isotropic gamma source ranging from 0 to 15 MeV was used to determine lateral width and thickness of the detector stages that provided the optimal detection efficiency. Then, the gamma source was replaced by a proton beam irradiating a tissue phantom to calculate the overall efficiency of the optimized camera for detecting emitted prompt gammas. The overall calculated efficiencies varied from ∼ 10(-6) to 10(-3) prompt gammas detected per proton incident on the tissue phantom for several variations of the optimal camera design studied. Based on the overall efficiency results, we believe it feasible that a three-stage Compton camera could detect a sufficient number of prompt gammas to allow measurement and imaging of prompt gamma emission during proton radiotherapy.},

The effect of the inhomogeneous deposition of radiation energy inherent in exposure to radiation of significantly non-zero LET is included in these relations which apply to radiation of any LET. The values of the kinetic rate and time constants for repair and the processes that lead to cell death postulated in the model, which compose the alpha and beta parameters of the linear-quadratic survival relation, are estimated from cell survival experiments and DNA double-strand break measurements from the literature.

	abstract = {A simplified method for the calculation of mammalian cell survival after charged particle irradiation is presented that is based on the track structure model of Scholz and Kraft [1, 2]. Utilizing a modified linear-quadratic relation for the x-ray survival curve, one finds that the model yields linear-quadratic relations also for heavy ion irradiation. If survival is calculated as a function of specific energy, z, in the cell nucleus--thus reducing the stochastic fluctuations of energy deposition--the increase in slope of the survival curve and therefore the coefficient beta z can be estimated with sufficient accuracy from the initial slope, alpha z. This permits the tabulation of the coefficients alpha z for the particle types and energies of interest, and subsequent fast calculations of survival levels at any point in a mixed particle beam. The complexity of the calculations can thereby be reduced in a wide range of applications, which permits the rapid calculations that are required for treatment planning in heavy ion therapy. The validity of the modified computations is assessed by the comparison with explicit calculations in terms of the original model and with experimental results for track-segment conditions. The model is then used to analyze the influence of beam fragmentation on the biological effect of charged particle beams penetrating to different depths in tissue. In addition, cell-survival rates after neuron irradiation are computed from the slowing-down spectra of secondary charged particles and are compared to experimental observations.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the impact of filling volume changes of the urinary bladder and rectum on organ motion and dose distribution of the bladder and rectum during radical radiotherapy for bladder cancer and to calculate the internal margins to secure target coverage.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 15 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, a planning CT scan was performed with a bladder and rectal catheter, followed by three immediate CT scans with various filling of the urinary bladder and rectum. After 20 fractions, a fifth CT scan, without catherization, was performed. In each CT study, the bladder and rectum volumes were delineated and matched to the planning CT scan to measure the organ motion and calculate internal margins. These margins were compared with an isotropic standard margin of 2 cm. Dose-volume histograms were analyzed to describe the dose distribution in the bladder and rectum corresponding to various filling volumes.
RESULTS: Bladder movement was most pronounced in the anterior and cranial directions. The internal margins required to cover the bladder movements due to filling of the bladder and rectum in 87\% of the patients were 2.4 cm in the anterior, 1.1 cm in the posterior, 3.5 cm in the cranial, 0.5 cm in the caudal, and 1.3 cm in the lateral direction.
CONCLUSION: The filling volumes of the bladder and rectum have a large impact on bladder movements, especially in the anterior and cranial directions. This should be included in the internal target volume with the introduction of anisotropic margins in conformal radiotherapy for bladder cancer.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: For 23 patients, an off-line positron emission tomography scan and a computed tomography scan after proton radiotherapy was performed at the Massachusetts General Hospital to assess in vivo treatment verification. A well-balanced population of patients was investigated to assess the effect of the tumor location on the accuracy of the technique.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Range verification was achieved by comparing the measured positron emission tomography activity distributions with the corresponding Monte Carlo-simulated distributions. Observed differences in the distal end of the activity distributions were analyzed as potential indicators for the range differences between the actual delivered and planned dose.
RESULTS: The average spatial agreement between the measured and simulated activity distribution was within ±3 mm, and the corresponding average absolute agreement was within ±45\% (derived from gamma index analysis). The mean absolute range deviation at 93 randomly chosen positions in 17 treatment fields delivered to 11 patients was 3.6 mm. Characteristic differences in the agreement of the measured and simulated activity distribution for the different tumor/target sites were found. This resulted from the different effect of factors such as biologic washout effects, motion, or limitations in the Monte Carlo-simulated activity patterns.
CONCLUSION: We found that intracranial and cervical spine patients can greatly benefit from off-line positron emission tomography and computed tomography range verification. However, for the successful application of the method to patients with abdominopelvic tumors, major technological and methodologic improvements are needed. Among the intracranial and cervical spine target sites, patients with arteriovenous malformations or metal implants represent groups that could especially benefit from the approach.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess three-dimensional tumor motion caused by respiration and internal target volume (ITV) for radiotherapy of lung cancer.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Respiration-induced tumor motion was analyzed for 166 tumors from 152 lung cancer patients, 57.2\% of whom had Stage III or IV non-small-cell lung cancer. All patients underwent four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) during normal breathing before treatment. The expiratory phase of 4DCT images was used as the reference set to delineate gross tumor volume (GTV). Gross tumor volumes on other respiratory phases and resulting ITVs were determined using rigid-body registration of 4DCT images. The association of GTV motion with various clinical and anatomic factors was analyzed statistically.
RESULTS: The proportions of tumors that moved {\textgreater}0.5 cm along the superior-inferior (SI), lateral, and anterior-posterior (AP) axes during normal breathing were 39.2\%, 1.8\%, and 5.4\%, respectively. For 95\% of the tumors, the magnitude of motion was less than 1.34 cm, 0.40 cm, and 0.59 cm along the SI, lateral, and AP directions. The principal component of tumor motion was in the SI direction, with only 10.8\% of tumors moving {\textgreater}1.0 cm. The tumor motion was found to be associated with diaphragm motion, the SI tumor location in the lung, size of the GTV, and disease T stage.
CONCLUSIONS: Lung tumor motion is primarily driven by diaphragm motion. The motion of locally advanced lung tumors is unlikely to exceed 1.0 cm during quiet normal breathing except for small lesions located in the lower half of the lung.},

	abstract = {Compton cameras have been developed for use in gamma-ray astronomy and nuclear medicine. Their defining merit is that they do not need collimators; however, on the demerit side, they need inversion procedures for image reconstruction, since a measured datum is proportional to the integration of incident gamma rays along a cone surface with the same Compton scattering angle. First, an iteration method was adopted for this task. Later, analytical methods were found under restricted conditions. Parra (2000 IEEE Trans. Nucl. Sci . 47 1543–50) deduced a purely analytical reconstruction algorithm for a complete set of scattering-projection data that include data at all the scattering angles. Tomitani and Hirasawa (2002 Phys. Med. Biol. [/0031-9155/47/12/309] 47 2129–45 ) found that by making a slight modification, Parra's algorithm could be extended to the scattering-projection data in limited scattering angles. However, their algorithm neglected the effects of practical problems that cause the degradation of spatial resolution. Sources of degradation were identified as noise in the energy signal of their front detector and the Doppler effect in the scattering process. In this paper, we first analyse the effects of these sources on the angular resolution of the scattering-projection data and then present a revised reconstruction algorithm in which these two factors are incorporated. Simulation studies on digital phantoms reveal that the algorithm can reconstruct images even when these two factors are included.},

	abstract = {We present a proof of principle study of proton radiography and proton computed tomography (pCT) based on time-resolved dose measurements. We used a prototype, two-dimensional, diode-array detector capable of fast dose rate measurements, to acquire proton radiographic images expressed directly in water equivalent path length (WEPL). The technique is based on the time dependence of the dose distribution delivered by a proton beam traversing a range modulator wheel in passive scattering proton therapy systems. The dose rate produced in the medium by such a system is periodic and has a unique pattern in time at each point along the beam path and thus encodes the WEPL. By measuring the time dose pattern at the point of interest, the WEPL to this point can be decoded. If one measures the time–dose patterns at points on a plane behind the patient for a beam with sufficient energy to penetrate the patient, the obtained 2D distribution of the WEPL forms an image. The technique requires only a 2D dosimeter array and it uses only the clinical beam for a fraction of second with negligible dose to patient. We first evaluated the accuracy of the technique in determining the WEPL for static phantoms aiming at beam range verification of the brain fields of medulloblastoma patients. Accurate beam ranges for these fields can significantly reduce the dose to the cranial skin of the patient and thus the risk of permanent alopecia. Second, we investigated the potential features of the technique for real-time imaging of a moving phantom. Real-time tumor tracking by proton radiography could provide more accurate validations of tumor motion models due to the more sensitive dependence of proton beam on tissue density compared to x-rays. Our radiographic technique is rapid ({\textasciitilde}100 ms) and simultaneous over the whole field, it can image mobile tumors without the problem of interplay effect inherently challenging for methods based on pencil beams. Third, we present the reconstructed pCT images of a cylindrical phantom containing inserts of different materials. As for all conventional pCT systems, the method illustrated in this work produces tomographic images that are potentially more accurate than x-ray CT in providing maps of proton relative stopping power (RSP) in the patient without the need for converting x-ray Hounsfield units to proton RSP. All phantom tests produced reasonable results, given the currently limited spatial and time resolution of the prototype detector. The dose required to produce one radiographic image, with the current settings, is {\textasciitilde}0.7 cGy. Finally, we discuss a series of techniques to improve the resolution and accuracy of radiographic and tomographic images for the future development of a full-scale detector.},

A water phantom was irradiated with clinical 114 MeV and 150 MeV proton pencil beams. Up to 500 cGy of dose was delivered per irradiation using clinical beam currents. The prototype CC was placed 15 cm from the beam central axis and PGs from 0.2 MeV up to 6.5 MeV were measured during irradiation. From the measured data (2D) images of the PG emission were reconstructed. (1D) profiles were extracted from the PG images and compared to measured depth dose curves of the delivered proton pencil beams. The CC was able to measure PG emission during delivery of both 114 MeV and 150 MeV proton beams at clinical beam currents. 2D images of the PG emission were reconstructed for single 150 MeV proton pencil beams as well as for a 5 × 5 cm mono-energetic layer of 114 MeV pencil beams. Shifts in the Bragg peak (BP) range were detectable on the 2D images. 1D profiles extracted from the PG images show that the distal falloff of the PG emission profile lined up well with the distal BP falloff. Shifts as small as 3 mm in the beam range could be detected from the 1D PG profiles with an accuracy of 1.5 mm or better. However, with the current CC prototype, a dose of 400 cGy was required to acquire adequate PG signal for 2D PG image reconstruction. It was possible to measure PG interactions with our prototype CC during delivery of proton pencil beams at clinical dose rates. Images of the PG emission could be reconstructed and shifts in the BP range were detectable. Therefore PGI with a CC for in vivo range verification during proton treatment delivery is feasible. However, improvements in the prototype CC detection efficiency and reconstruction algorithms are necessary to make it a clinically viable PGI system.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The authors investigated how the characteristics of the detectors used in a three-stage Compton camera (CC) affect the CC's ability to accurately measure the emission distribution and energy spectrum of prompt gammas (PG) emitted by nuclear de-excitations during proton therapy. The detector characteristics they studied included the material (high-purity germanium [HPGe] and cadmium zinc telluride [CZT]), Doppler broadening (DB), and resolution (lateral, depth, and energy)., Methods: The authors simulated three-stage HPGe and CZT CCs of various configurations, detecting gammas from point sources with energies ranging from 0.511 to 7.12 MeV. They also simulated a proton pencil beam irradiating a tissue target to study how the detector characteristics affect the PG data measured by CCs in a clinical proton therapy setting. They used three figures of merit: the distance of closest approach (DCA) and the point of closest approach (PCA) between the measured and actual position of the PG emission origin, and the calculated energy resolution., Results: For CCs with HPGe detectors, DB caused the DCA to be greater than 3 mm for 14\% of the 6.13 MeV gammas and 20\% of the 0.511 MeV gammas. For CCs with CZT detectors, DB caused the DCA to be greater than 3 mm for 18\% of the 6.13 MeV gammas and 25\% of the 0.511 MeV gammas.

For CCs composed of HPGe detectors, the resolution of incident gamma energy calculated by the CC ranged from 6\% to 1\% for gammas with true incident energies from 0.511 to 7.12 MeV. For CCs composed of CZT detectors, the resolution of gamma energy calculated by the CC ranged from 10\% to 1\% for gammas with true incident energies from 0.511 to 7.12 MeV. For HPGe and CZT CCs in which all detector effect were included, the DCA was less than 3 mm for 75\% and 68\% of the detected gammas, respectively, and restricting gammas to those having energy greater than 2.0 MeV increased these percentages to 83\% and 77\% for HPGe and CZT, respectively. Distributions of the true gamma origins and the PCA after detector characteristics had been included showed good agreement on beam range and some loss of resolution for the lateral profile of the PG emission. Characteristic energy lines were evident in the calculated gamma energy spectrum., Conclusions: The authors found the following: (1) DB is the dominant source of spatial and energy resolution loss in the CCs at all energy levels; (2) the largest difference in the spatial resolution of HPGe and CZT CCs is that the spatial resolution distributions of CZT have broader tails. The differences in the FWHM of these distributions are small; (3) the energy resolution of both HPGe and CZT three-stage CCs is adequate for PG spectroscopy; and (4) restricting the gammas to those having energy greater than 2.0 MeV can improve the achievable image resolution.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.prro.2014.08.002},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: We compared conventionally optimized intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) treatment plans against worst-case scenario optimized treatment plans for lung cancer. The comparison of the 2 IMPT optimization strategies focused on the resulting plans' ability to retain dose objectives under the influence of patient setup, inherent proton range uncertainty, and dose perturbation caused by respiratory motion.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: For each of the 9 lung cancer cases, 2 treatment plans were created that accounted for treatment uncertainties in 2 different ways. The first used the conventional method: delivery of prescribed dose to the planning target volume that is geometrically expanded from the internal target volume (ITV). The second used a worst-case scenario optimization scheme that addressed setup and range uncertainties through beamlet optimization. The plan optimality and plan robustness were calculated and compared. Furthermore, the effects on dose distributions of changes in patient anatomy attributable to respiratory motion were investigated for both strategies by comparing the corresponding plan evaluation metrics at the end-inspiration and end-expiration phase and absolute differences between these phases. The mean plan evaluation metrics of the 2 groups were compared with 2-sided paired Student t tests.
RESULTS: Without respiratory motion considered, we affirmed that worst-case scenario optimization is superior to planning target volume-based conventional optimization in terms of plan robustness and optimality. With respiratory motion considered, worst-case scenario optimization still achieved more robust dose distributions to respiratory motion for targets and comparable or even better plan optimality (D95\% ITV, 96.6\% vs 96.1\% [P = .26]; D5\%- D95\% ITV, 10.0\% vs 12.3\% [P = .082]; D1\% spinal cord, 31.8\% vs 36.5\% [P = .035]).
CONCLUSIONS: Worst-case scenario optimization led to superior solutions for lung IMPT. Despite the fact that worst-case scenario optimization did not explicitly account for respiratory motion, it produced motion-resistant treatment plans. However, further research is needed to incorporate respiratory motion into IMPT robust optimization.},

In addition to the hotspot imaging already provided by commercial imaging systems, identification of various radioisotopes is possible thanks to the good energy resolution obtained by the semiconductor detectors. Three radioisotopes of 133Ba (356 keV), 22Na (511 keV) and 137Cs (662 keV) were individually imaged by applying event selection in the energy window and the gamma-ray images were correctly overlapped by an optical picture. Detection efficiency of 1.68 ×10−4 (effective area: 1.7×10−3 cm2) and angular resolution of 3.8 degrees were obtained by stacking five detector modules for a 662 keV gamma ray. The higher detection efficiency required in specific use can be achieved by stacking more detector modules.},

	abstract = {Proton computed tomography (CT) has been described as a solution for imaging the proton stopping power of patient tissues, therefore reducing the uncertainty of the conversion of x-ray CT images to relative stopping power (RSP) maps and its associated margins. This study aimed to investigate this assertion under the assumption of ideal detection systems. We have developed a Monte Carlo framework to assess proton CT performances for the main steps of a proton therapy treatment planning, i.e. proton or x-ray CT imaging, conversion to RSP maps based on the calibration of a tissue phantom, and proton dose simulations. Irradiations of a computational phantom with pencil beams were simulated on various anatomical sites and the proton range was assessed on the reference, the proton CT-based and the x-ray CT-based material maps. Errors on the tissue’s RSP reconstructed from proton CT were found to be significantly smaller and less dependent on the tissue distribution. The imaging dose was also found to be much more uniform and conformal to the primary beam. The mean absolute deviation for range calculations based on x-ray CT varies from 0.18 to 2.01 mm depending on the localization, while it is smaller than 0.1 mm for proton CT. Under the assumption of a perfect detection system, proton range predictions based on proton CT are therefore both more accurate and more uniform than those based on x-ray CT.},

	abstract = {Hadron therapy, a subject of study by the ENVISION project, promises to provide enhanced accuracy in the treatment of cancer. The Bragg-peak, characteristic of the hadron-beam structure provides larger dose to the tumor while being able to spare surrounding tissue - even tissues in the beam-path, beyond the tumor-site. However, increased dose gradients require more precise treatment, as small beam misalignment can result in dose to healthy, often delicate, surrounding tissue. The requirement for accuracy necessitates imaging during therapy, yet the lack of a transmitted beam makes this difficult. The particulate beam interacts with the target material producing neutrons, positron emitting isotopes and a broad spectra of gamma radiation. Photons from positron-annihilation allow in-beam PET to provide on-line measurements of dose deposition during therapy. However, ib-PET suffers from low statistics and lost projections due to low sensitivity and detector constraints respectively. Instead, Compton imaging of gamma radiation is proposed to provide on-line monitoring for hadron therapy. Compton imaging suffers similarly from low statistics, especially, as is the case here, when incident energy is unknown. To surmount this problem, a method of Compton image reconstruction is proposed and tested using simulated data, which reconstructs incident energy along with the spatial variation in emission density. Through incident energy estimation, a larger range of measurements are available for image-reconstruction - greatly increasing the sensitivity of the system. It is shown in this preliminary study that, even with few statistics, a reasonable estimate of the beam path is calculable.},

This detector system consists of four independent CdZnTe detector stages and a coincidence module, allowing the user to construct a Compton camera in different geometrical configurations and to accept both double and triple scatter events. Energy resolution for the 662 keV line from 137Cs was found to be 9.7 keV FWHM. The raw absolute efficiencies for double and triple scatter events were 2.2 × 10 − 5 and 5.8 × 10 − 7 , respectively, for γs from a 60Co source. The position resolution for the reconstruction of a point source from the measured CC data was about 2 mm. Overall, due to the low efficiency of the Polaris J CC, the current system was deemed not viable for imaging PGs emitted during proton RT treatment delivery. However, using a validated Monte Carlo model of the CC, we found that by increasing the size of the detectors and placing them in a two stage configuration, the efficiency could be increased to a level to make PG imaging possible during proton RT.},

METHODS/DESIGN: A total of 240 patients will be recruited, evenly sampled among different analysis groups including tumors of the brain, skull base, head and neck region, upper gastrointestinal tract including the liver, lower gastrointestinal tract, prostate and pelvic region. From the comparison of the measured activity with the planned dose and its corresponding simulated activity distribution, conclusions on the delivered treatment will be inferred and, in case of significant deviations, correction strategies will be elaborated.
DISCUSSION: The investigated patients are expected to benefit from this study, since in case of detected deviations between planned and actual treatment delivery a proper intervention (e.g., correction) could be performed in a subsequent irradiation fraction. In this way, an overall better treatment could be achieved than without any in-vivo verification. Moreover, site-specific patient-population information on the precision of the ion range at HIT might enable improvement of the CT-range calibration curve as well as safe reduction of the treatment margins to promote enhanced treatment plan conformality and dose escalation for full clinical exploitation of the promises of ion beam therapy.

A method is described to determine improved CT calibrations for biological tissue (a stoichiometric calibration) based on measurements using tissue equivalent materials. The precision of this stoichiometric calibration and the more usual tissue substitute calibration is determined by a comparison of calculated proton radiographic images based on these calibrations and measured radiographs of a biological sample.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to establish the in vivo verification of proton beam path by using proton-activated positron emission distributions.
METHODS: A total of 50 PET/CT imaging studies were performed on ten prostate cancer patients immediately after daily proton therapy treatment through a single lateral portal. The PET/CT and planning CT were registered by matching the pelvic bones, and the beam path of delivered protons was defined in vivo by the positron emission distribution seen only within the pelvic bones, referred to as the PET-defined beam path. Because of the patient position correction at each fraction, the marker-defined beam path, determined by the centroid of implanted markers seen in the posttreatment (post-Tx) CT, is used for the planned beam path. The angular variation and discordance between the PET- and marker-defined paths were derived to investigate the intrafraction prostate motion. For studies with large discordance, the relative location between the centroid and pelvic bones seen in the post-Tx CT was examined. The PET/CT studies are categorized for distinguishing the prostate motion that occurred before or after beam delivery. The post-PET CT was acquired after PET imaging to investigate prostate motion due to physiological changes during the extended PET acquisition.
RESULTS: The less than 2 degrees of angular variation indicates that the patient roll was minimal within the immobilization device. Thirty of the 50 studies with small discordance, referred as good cases, show a consistent alignment between the field edges and the positron emission distributions from the entrance to the distal edge. For those good cases, average displacements are 0.6 and 1.3 mm along the anterior-posterior (D(AP)) and superior-inferior (D(SI)) directions, respectively, with 1.6 mm standard deviations in both directions. For the remaining 20 studies demonstrating a large discordance (more than 6 mm in either D(AP) or D(SI)), 13 studies, referred as motion-after-Tx cases, also show large misalignment between the field edge and the positron emission distribution in lipomatous tissues around the prostate. These motion-after-Tx cases correspond to patients with large changes in volume of rectal gas between the post-Tx and the post-PET CTs. The standard deviations for D(AP) and D(SI) are 5.0 and 3.0 mm, respectively, for these motion-after-Tx cases. The final seven studies, referred to as position-error cases, which had a large discordance but no misalignment, were found to have deviations of 4.6 and 3.6 mm in D(AP) and D(SI), respectively. The position-error cases correspond to a large discrepancy on the relative location between the centroid and pelvic bones seen in post-Tx CT and recorded x-ray radiographs.
CONCLUSIONS: Systematic analyses of proton-activated positron emission distributions provide patient-specific information on prostate motion (sigmaM) and patient position variability (sigmap) during daily proton beam delivery. The less than 2 mm of displacement variations in the good cases indicates that population-based values of sigmap and sigmaM, used in margin algorithms for treatment planning at the authors' institution are valid for the majority of cases. However, a small fraction of PET/CT studies (approximately 14\%) with -4 mm displacement variations may require different margins. Such data are useful in establishing patient-specific planning target volume margins.},

Apart from the challenge arising from the Compton camera design, another price must be paid: the complex image reconstruction process of the object under study from the measured Compton scattered data. In this paper, a mathematical model of projections generated by photons scattered in a generic Compton camera is defined, relating the projections to the object by an integral transform, namely the Compton transform. The set of projections can be split into subsets following the slope α of the direction of the scattered photons. We show that each subset allows us to invert the Compton transform and exactly recover the image of the object. In practical applications, where the number of acquired photons is low and each reconstructed image is noisy, averaging improves dramatically the signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, the validity of the approach is proved by numerical experiments.},

	abstract = {Compton Cameras emerged as an alternative for real-time dose monitoring techniques for Particle Therapy (PT), based on the detection of prompt-gammas. As a consequence of the Compton scattering process, the gamma origin point can be restricted onto the surface of a cone (Compton cone). Through image reconstruction techniques, the distribution of the gamma emitters can be estimated, using cone-surfaces backprojections of the Compton cones through the image space, along with more sophisticated statistical methods to improve the image quality. To calculate the Compton cone required for image reconstruction, either two interactions, the last being photoelectric absorption, or three scatter interactions are needed. Because of the high energy of the photons in PT the first option might not be adequate, as the photon is not absorbed in general. However, the second option is less efficient. That is the reason to resort to spectral reconstructions, where the incoming γ energy is considered as a variable in the reconstruction inverse problem. Jointly with prompt gamma, secondary neutrons and scattered photons, not strongly correlated with the dose map, can also reach the imaging detector and produce false events. These events deteriorate the image quality. Also, high intensity beams can produce particle accumulation in the camera, which lead to an increase of random coincidences, meaning events which gather measurements from different incoming particles. The noise scenario is expected to be different if double or triple events are used, and consequently, the reconstructed images can be affected differently by spurious data. The aim of the present work is to study the effect of false events in the reconstructed image, evaluating their impact in the determination of the beam particle ranges. A simulation study that includes misidentified events (neutrons and random coincidences) in the final image of a Compton Telescope for PT monitoring is presented. The complete chain of detection, from the beam particle entering a phantom to the event classification, is simulated using FLUKA. The range determination is later estimated from the reconstructed image obtained from a two and three-event algorithm based on Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization. The neutron background and random coincidences due to a therapeutic-like time structure are analyzed for mono-energetic proton beams. The time structure of the beam is included in the simulations, which will affect the rate of particles entering the detector.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Proton doses are sensitive to intra- and interfractional anatomic changes. We analyzed the effects of interfractional anatomic changes in doses to lung tumors treated with proton therapy.

Methods and Materials
Weekly four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT) scans were acquired for 8 patients with mobile Stage III non–small cell lung cancer who were actually treated with intensity-modulated photon radiotherapy. A conformal proton therapy passive scattering plan was designed for each patient. Dose distributions were recalculated at end-inspiration and end-expiration breathing phases on each weekly 4D-CT data set using the same plans with alignment based on bone registration.

Results
Clinical target volume (CTV) coverage was compromised (from 99\% to 90.9\%) in 1 patient because of anatomic changes and motion pattern variation. For the rest of the patients, the mean CTV coverage on the repeated weekly 4D-CT data sets was 98.4\%, compared with 99\% for the original plans. For all 8 patients, however, a mean 4\% increase in the volume of the contralateral lung receiving a dose of at least 5 Gy (V5) and a mean 4.4-Gy increase in the spinal cord maximum dose was observed in the repeated 4D-CT data sets. A strong correlation between the CTV density change resulting from tumor shrinkage or anatomic variations and mean contralateral lung dose was observed.

Conclusions
Adaptive re-planning during proton therapy may be indicated in selected patients with non–small cell lung cancer. For most patients, however, CTV coverage is adequate if tumor motion is taken into consideration in the original simulation and planning processes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Relative to X-ray beams, proton [(1)H] and carbon ion [(12)C] beams provide superior distributions due primarily to their finite range. The principal differences are LET, low for (1)H and high for (12)C, and a narrower penumbra of (12)C beams. Were (12)C to yield a higher TCP for a defined NTCP than (1)H therapy, would LET, fractionation or penumbra width be the basis?
METHODS: Critical factors of physics, radiation biology of (1)H and (12)C ion beams, neutron therapy and selected reports of TCP and NTCP from (1)H and (12)C irradiation of nine tumor categories are reviewed.
RESULTS: Outcome results are based on low dose per fraction (1)H and high dose per fraction (12)C therapy. Assessment of the role of LET and dose distribution vs dose fractionation is not now feasible. Available data indicate that TCP increases with BED with (1)H and (12)C TCPs overlaps. Frequencies of GIII NTCPs were higher after (1)H than (12)C treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of the efficacy of (1)H vs(12)C therapy is not feasible, principally due to the dose fractionation differences. Further, there is no accepted policy for defining the CTV-GTV margin nor definition of TCP. Overlaps of (1)H and (12)C ion TCPs at defined BED ranges indicate that TCPs are determined in large measure by dose, BED. Late GIII NTCP was higher in (1)H than (12)C patients, indicating LET as a significant factor. We recommend trials of (1)H vs(12)C with one variable, i.e. LET. The resultant TCP vs NTCP relationship will indicate which beam yields higher TCP for a specified NTCP at a defined dose fractionation.},

	doi = {10.1088/0031-9155/58/7/2103},
	abstract = {Proton relative biological effectiveness (RBE) is known to depend on the (α/β)x of irradiated tissues, with evidence of ∼60\% variation over (α/β)x values from 1-10 Gy. The range of (α/β)x values reported for prostate tumors (1.2-5.0 Gy), brain tumors (10-15 Gy) and liver tumors (13-17 Gy) imply that the proton RBE for these tissues could vary significantly compared to the commonly used generic value of 1.1. Our aim is to evaluate the impact of this uncertainty on the proton dose in Gy(RBE) absorbed in normal and tumor tissues. This evaluation was performed for standard and hypofractionated regimens. RBE-weighted total dose (RWTD) distributions for 15 patients (five prostate tumors, five brain tumors and five liver tumors) were calculated using an in-house developed RBE model as a function of dose, dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LETd) and (α/β)x. Variations of the dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the gross tumor volume (GTV) and the organs at risk due to changes of (α/β)x and fractionation regimen were calculated and the RWTD received by 10\% and 90\% of the organ volume reported. The goodness of the plan, bearing the uncertainties, was then evaluated compared to the delivered plan, which considers a constant RBE of 1.1. For standard fractionated regimens, the prostate tumors, liver tumors and all critical structures in the brain showed typically larger RBE values than 1.1. However, in hypofractionated regimens lower values of RBE than 1.1 were observed in most cases. Based on DVH analysis we found that the RBE variations were clinically significant in particular for the prostate GTV and the critical structures in the brain. Despite the uncertainties in the biological input parameters when estimating RBE values, the results show that the use of a variable RBE with dose, LETd and (α/β)x could help to further optimize the target dose in proton treatment planning. Most importantly, this study shows that the consideration of RBE variations could influence the comparison of proton and photon treatments in clinical trials, in particular in the case of the prostate.},

	abstract = {Compton scattering is a potential tool for the determination of bone mineral content or tissue density for dose planning purposes, and requires knowledge of the energy distribution of the X-rays through biological materials of medical interest in the X-ray and (gamma) -ray region. The energy distribution is utilized in a number of ways in diagnostic radiology, for example, in determining primary photon spectra, electron densities in separate volumes, and in tomography and imaging. The choice of the X-ray energy is more related to X-ray absorption, where as that of the scattering angle is more related to geometry. The evaluation of all the contributions are mandatory in Compton profile measurements and is important in X-ray imaging systems in order to achieve good results. In view of this, Compton profile cross-sections for few biological materials are estimated at nineteen K(alpha) X-ray energies and 60 keV (Am-241) photons. Energy broadening, geometrical broadening from 1 to 180 degree(s), FWHM of J(Pz) and FWHM of Compton energy broadening has been evaluated at various incident photon energies. These values are estimated around the centroid of the Compton profile with an energy interval of 0.1 keV and 1.0 keV for 60 keV photons. The interaction cross sections for the above materials are estimated using fractions-by-weight of the constituent elements. Input data for these tables are purely theoretical.},

The response of the Compton camera to a photon point source with a realistic energy spectrum (corresponding to the prompt γ-ray spectrum emitted during the carbon irradiation of a water phantom) is studied by means of Geant4 simulations. Our Compton camera consists of a stack of 2 mm thick silicon strip detectors as a scatter detector and of a scintillator plate as an absorber detector. Four scintillators are considered: LYSO, NaI, LaBr3 and BGO. LYSO and BGO appear as the most suitable materials, due to their high photo-electric cross-sections, which leads to a high percentage of fully absorbed photons. Depth-of-interaction measurements are shown to have limited influence on the spatial resolution of the camera. In our case, the thickness which gives the best compromise between a high percentage of photons that are fully absorbed and a low parallax error is about 4 cm for the LYSO detector and 4.5 cm for the BGO detector. The influence of the width of the absorber detector on the spatial resolution is not very pronounced as long as it is lower than 30 cm.},

	Abstract = {For real-time monitoring of the longitudinal position of the Bragg-peak during an ion therapy treatment, a novel non-invasive technique has been recently proposed that exploits the detection of prompt gamma-rays issued from nuclear fragmentation. Two series of experiments have been performed at the GANIL and GSI facilities with 95 and 305 MeV/u (12)C(6+) ion beams stopped in PMMA and water phantoms. In both experiments, a clear correlation was obtained between the carbon ion range and the prompt photon profile. Additionally, an extensive study has been performed to investigate whether a prompt neutron component may be correlated with the carbon ion range. No such correlation was found. The present paper demonstrates that a collimated set-up can be used to detect single photons by means of time-of-flight measurements, at those high energies typical for ion therapy. Moreover, the applicability of the technique both at cyclotron and at synchrotron facilities is shown. It is concluded that the detected photon count rates provide sufficiently high statistics to allow real-time control of the longitudinal position of the Bragg-peak under clinical conditions.},

	abstract = {Proton range monitoring may facilitate online adaptive proton therapy and improve treatment outcomes. Imaging of proton-induced prompt gamma (PG) rays using a knife-edge slit collimator is currently under investigation as a potential tool for real-time proton range monitoring. A major challenge in collimated PG imaging is the suppression of neutron-induced background counts. In this work, we present an initial performance test of two knife-edge slit camera prototypes based on arrays of digital photon counters (DPCs). PG profiles emitted from a PMMA target upon irradiation with a 160 MeV proton pencil beams (about 6.5 × 10(9) protons delivered in total) were measured using detector modules equipped with four DPC arrays coupled to BGO or LYSO : Ce crystal matrices. The knife-edge slit collimator and detector module were placed at 15 cm and 30 cm from the beam axis, respectively, in all cases. The use of LYSO : Ce enabled time-of-flight (TOF) rejection of background events, by synchronizing the DPC readout electronics with the 106 MHz radiofrequency signal of the cyclotron. The signal-to-background (S/B) ratio of 1.6 obtained with a 1.5 ns TOF window and a 3 MeV-7 MeV energy window was about 3 times higher than that obtained with the same detector module without TOF discrimination and 2 times higher than the S/B ratio obtained with the BGO module. Even 1 mm shifts of the Bragg peak position translated into clear and consistent shifts of the PG profile if TOF discrimination was applied, for a total number of protons as low as about 6.5 × 10(8) and a detector surface of 6.6 cm × 6.6 cm.},

	abstract = {A recent clinical pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of offline PET/CT range verification for proton therapy treatments. In vivo PET measurements are challenged by blood perfusion, variations of tissue compositions, patient motion and image co-registration uncertainties. Besides these biological and treatment specific factors, the accuracy of the method is constrained by the underlying physical processes. This phantom study distinguishes physical factors from other factors, assessing the reproducibility, consistency and sensitivity of the PET/CT range verification method. A spread-out Bragg-peak (SOBP) proton field was delivered to a phantom consisting of poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA), lung and bone equivalent material slabs. PET data were acquired in listmode at a commercial PET/CT scanner available within 10 min walking distance from the proton therapy unit. The measured PET activity distributions were compared to simulations of the PET signal based on Geant4 and FLUKA Monte Carlo (MC) codes. To test the reproducibility of the measured PET signal, data from two independent measurements at the same geometrical position in the phantom were compared. Furthermore, activation depth profiles within identical material arrangements but at different positions within the irradiation field were compared to test the consistency of the measured PET signal. Finally, activation depth profiles through air/lung, air/bone and lung/bone interfaces parallel as well as at 6 degrees to the beam direction were studied to investigate the sensitivity of the PET/CT range verification method. The reproducibility and the consistency of the measured PET signal were found to be of the same order of magnitude. They determine the physical accuracy of the PET measurement to be about 1 mm. However, range discrepancies up to 2.6 mm between two measurements and range variations up to 2.6 mm within one measurement were found at the beam edge and at the edge of the field of view (FOV) of the PET scanner. PET/CT range verification was found to be able to detect small range modifications in the presence of complex tissue inhomogeneities. This study indicates the physical potential of the PET/CT verification method to detect the full-range characteristic of the delivered dose in the patient.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Interfraction and intrafraction changes in amplitude of liver motion were assessed in patients with liver cancer treated with kV cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 314 CBCTs obtained with the patient in the treatment position immediately before and after each fraction, and 29 planning 4DCTs were evaluated in 29 patients undergoing six-fraction SBRT for unresectable liver cancer, with (n = 15) and without (n = 14) abdominal compression. Offline, the CBCTs were sorted into 10 bins, based on phase of respiration. Liver motion amplitude was measured using liver-to-liver alignment from the end-exhale and end-inhale CBCT and four-dimensional CT reconstructions. Inter- and intrafraction amplitude changes were measured from the difference between the pre-SBRT CBCTs relative to the planning four-dimensional CT, and from the pre-SBRT and post-SBRT CBCTs, respectively.
RESULTS: Mean liver motion amplitude for all patients (range) was 1.8 (0.1-7.0), 8.0 (0.1-18.8), and 4.3 (0.1-12.1) mm in the mediolateral (ML), craniocaudal (CC), and anteroposterior (AP) directions, respectively. Mean absolute inter- and intrafraction liver motion amplitude changes were 1.0 (ML), 1.7 (CC), and 1.6 (AP) mm and 1.3 (ML), 1.6 (CC), and 1.9 (AP) mm, respectively. No significant correlations were found between intrafraction amplitude change and intrafraction time (range, 4:56-25:37 min:sec), and between inter- and intrafraction amplitude changes and liver motion amplitude. Intraobserver reproducibility (sigma, n = 29 fractions) was 1.3 (ML), 1.4 (CC), and 1.4 (AP) mm.
CONCLUSIONS: For the majority of liver SBRT patients, the change in liver motion amplitude was minimal over the treatment course and showed no apparent relationships with the magnitude of liver motion and intrafraction time.},

	abstract = {Compton camera systems can be used to image sources of gamma radiation in a variety of applications such as nuclear medicine, homeland security and nuclear decommissioning. To locate gamma-ray sources, a Compton camera employs electronic collimation, utilising Compton kinematics to reconstruct the paths of gamma rays which interact within the detectors. The main benefit of this technique is the ability to accurately identify and locate sources of gamma radiation within a wide field of view, vastly improving the efficiency and specificity over existing devices. Potential advantages of this imaging technique, along with advances in detector technology, have brought about a rapidly expanding area of research into the optimisation of Compton camera systems, which relies on significant input from Monte-Carlo simulations. In this paper, the functionality of a Compton camera application that has been integrated into GAMOS, the GEANT4-based Architecture for Medicine-Oriented Simulations, is described. The application simplifies the use of GEANT4 for Monte-Carlo investigations by employing a script based language and plug-in technology. To demonstrate the use of the Compton camera application, simulated data have been generated using the GAMOS application and acquired through experiment for a preliminary validation, using a Compton camera configured with double sided high purity germanium strip detectors.

	abstract = {Purpose: In clinical proton beam radiation therapy, an RBE of 1.1 relative to megavoltage X-rays is currently being employed at most treatment centers. This RBE pertains to radiation in the spread out Bragg-peak (SOBP) for all tissue systems, all dose levels per fraction and all proton beam energies. As the number of centers and treatment sites for which proton beam therapy continues to increase and additional experimental data is accrued, a re-assessment of the justification for a generic RBE is warranted. In this paper we address: (1) the constancy of the RBE along the central axis from the plateau entrance to the distal SOBP (upstream of the distal edge); (2) RBE as a function of dose (or cell survival level); and (3) the target cell or tissue (α/β) dependency of the RBE. This analysis pertains to modulated proton beams of initial energies of approximately 70–200 MeV and SOBPs of approximately 2–10 cm, respectively.

Results and conclusions: With exceptions, the available experimental data indicate that the RBE of SOBP protons increases with decreasing dose or dose per fraction and increasing depth in the SOBP, with the magnitude of both effects likely being dependent on the α/β ratios of the target cells or tissues. The use of a generic RBE of 1.1 for all tissues, especially those exhibiting low α/β values such as CNS, may be too low, especially at dose levels of ≤2 Gy/fraction. Systematic determination of the RBE values dependent upon the three interdependent variables identified in this manuscript (beam depth, dose size and target tissue) will provide an enhanced data base for detailed treatment planning and institutional trial comparisons, thereby maximizing the therapeutic benefit of proton beams.},

Water equivalent tissue (WET) calibrated proton radiographs of a dog patient treated for a nasal tumor were used as baseline in comparison with integrated proton stopping power through the calibrated CT of the dog. In an optimization procedure starting with a stoichiometric calibration curve, the calibration was modified randomly. The result of this iteration is an optimized calibration curve which was used to recalculate the dose distribution of the patient. One result of this experiment was that the mean value of the deviations between WET calculations based on the stoichiometric calibration curve and the measurements was shifted systematically away from zero. The calibration produced by the optimization procedure reduced this shift to around 0.4 mm. Another result was that the precision of the calibration, reflected as the standard deviation of the normally distributed deviations between WET calculation and measurement, could be reduced from 7.9 to 6.7 mm with the optimized calibration. The dose distributions based on the two calibration curves showed major deviations at the distal end of the target volume.},

Using a simple track analysis for a quick first test of the performance, the gamma-ray imaging capability was demonstrated with clear images and 5.3 degrees of angular resolution measure (ARM) measured at 662 keV. As the greatest impact of this work, a gamma-ray detection efficiency on the order of 10 −4 was achieved at the sub-MeV gamma-ray band, which is one order of magnitude higher than our previous experiment. This angular resolution and detection efficiency enables us to detect the Crab Nebula at the 5σ level with several hours observation at balloon altitude in middle latitude. Furthermore, good consistency of efficiencies between this performance test and simulation including only physical processes is very important; it means we achieve nearly 100\% detection of Compton recoil electrons and means that our predictions of performance enhancement resulting from future upgrades are more realistic. We are planning to confirm the imaging capability of the ETCC by observation of celestial objects in the SMILE-II (Sub-MeV gamma ray Imaging Loaded-on-balloon Experiment II). The SMILE-II and following SMILE-III project will be an important key of sub-MeV/MeV gamma-ray astronomy.},

	volume = {39},

	doi = {10.1118/1.3694098},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: In vivo range verification is one of the most important parts of proton therapy to fully utilize its benefits delivering high radiation dose to tumor, while sparing the normal tissue with the so-called Bragg peak. Currently, however, range verification method is not used in clinics. The purpose of the present study is to optimize and evaluate the configuration of an array-type prompt gamma measurement system on determining distal dose edge for in vivo range verification of proton therapy.
METHODS: To effectively measure the prompt gammas against the background gammas, the Monte Carlo simulations with the MCNPX code were employed in optimizing the configuration of the measurement system, and the Monte Carlo method was also used to understand the effect of the background gammas, mainly neutron capture gammas, in the measured gamma distribution. To reduce the effect of the background gammas, the optimized energy window of 4-10 MeV in measuring the prompt gammas was employed. A parameterized source was used to maximize computation speed in the optimization study. A simplified test measurement system, using only one detector moving from one measurement location to the next, was constructed and applied to therapeutic proton beams of 80-220 MeV. For accurate determination of the distal dose edge, the sigmoidal curve-fitting method was applied to the measured distributions of the prompt gammas, and then, the location of the half-value between the maximum and minimum value in the curve-fitting was determined as the distal dose edge and compared with the beam range assessed by the proton dose distribution.
RESULTS: The parameterized source term employed in optimization process improved the calculation speed by up to ∼300 times. The optimization study indicates that an array-type measurement system with 3, 2, 2, and 150 mm for scintillator thickness, slit width, septal thickness, and slit length, respectively, can effectively measure the prompt gamma distributions minimizing the contribution of background gammas. The present results show that a few hundred counts of prompt gammas can be easily obtained by measuring 10 s at each measurement location for proton beams of ∼4 nA. The distal dose edges determined by the prompt gamma distribution are 5.45, 14.73, and 27.74 cm for proton beams of 5.17 (80 MeV), 14.99 (150 MeV), and 27.38 (220 MeV) cm, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the array-type measurement system can measure prompt gamma distributions from a therapeutic proton beam within a short measurement time, and that the distal dose edge can be determined within a few millimeters of error without using any sophisticated analysis.},

	abstract = {Experiments with cultured mammalian cells exposed to ionizing radiation of varying LET are examined in the context of a microdosimetric-kinetic (MK) model of radiation induced mammalian. cell killing similar to the site model of the theory of dual radiation action. The experimentally measured RBE, in the limit of zero dose, increases linearly with LET for LET less than a value that lies in the range of about 40-90 keV per micron. It is shown that the tendency of the RBE to increase linearly with LET can be explained as a result of the random variation of specific energy among microscopic sized domains (sites), into which the nucleus may be partitioned, and the effect of this variation on the formation of lethal lesions by pairwise combination of repairable primary lesions in DNA. the microscopic subunits corresponding to a site have diameter in the range of 0.56-0.75 microns. The linearity of RBE with increasing LET implies that value of the quadratic parameter of the linear-quadratic survival relation (beta) is constant, at least for LET low enough to be in the linear range, and this in turn implies the production of primary DNA lesion, likely double strand breaks, does not increase with LET. the experiments, interpreted with MK model, also imply that the repairability and potential for lethality of the primary DNA lesion does not change with variation of LET within the linear range. The failure of RBE to maintain its linear increase for higher values of LET, and the resulting RBE maximum at about 100 keV per micron, are likely primarily due to the departure of the distribution of lethal lesions among cells from the Poisson distribution. Some implications concerning the use of radiation to treat cancer are noted.},

	abstract = {Modern PET systems reach a spatial resolution of 3-10 mm. A disadvantage of this technique is the diffusion of the positron before its decay with a typical range of ca. 1 mm (depending on its energy). This motion and Compton scattering of the 511 keV photons within the patient limit the performance of PET. We present a nuclear medical imaging technique, able to reach submillimeter spatial resolution in 3 dimensions with a reduced activity application compared to conventional PET. This 'gamma-PET' technique draws on specific positron sources simultaneously emitting an additional photon with the {\textbackslash}beta+ decay. Exploiting the triple coincidence between the positron annihilation and the third photon, it is possible to separate the reconstructed 'true' events from background. In order to test the feasibility of this technique, Monte-Carlo simulations and image reconstruction has been performed. The spatial resolution amounts to 0.2 mm (FWHM) in each direction, surpassing the performance of conventional PET by about an order of magnitude. The simulated detector geometry exhibits a coincidence detection efficiency of 1.92e-7 per decay. Starting with only 0.7 MBq of source activity (ca. 200-500 times less compared to conventional PET) an exposure time of 450 s is sufficient for source reconstruction.},

A spatial resolution of 8.6 mm in FWHM within a ±50 mm region (field of view) and a linear response of a 0.3 mm standard deviation within a ±200 mm region were obtained.

	doi = {10.1109/NSSMIC.2008.4774081},
	abstract = {We have developed the Electron tracking Compton Camera (ETCC) with reconstructing the 3-D tracks of the scattered electron in Compton process for both gamma-ray astronomy and medical imaging [1–3]. By measuring both the directions and energies of a recoil gamma ray and a scattered electron, the direction of the incident gamma ray is determined for an individual photon. Furthermore, a residual measured angle between the recoil electron and scattered gamma ray is powerful for the kinematical background-rejection. For the 3-D tracking of the electrons, the Micro Time Projection Chamber (μ-TPC) was developed, which consists of a new type of the micro pattern gas detector, or a Micro Pixel Gas Chamber (μ-PIC). The ETCC consists of this μ-TPC and the GSO crystal pixel arrays below the μ̃TPC for detecting the recoil gamma rays. The ETCC provided the gamma ray images of point sources between 120keV and ∼1 MeV with the angular resolution of 6 degree (FWHM) at 511keV of 18F ion, respectively. Also the angle of the scattered electron was measured with the resolution of ∼80 degree. Two mobile ETCCs with 10cm-cube TPC for small animal and 30cm-cube TPC for human body, are now being operated for Medical Imaging test. We have studied the imaging performances using both phantoms and small animals (rats and mice) for conventional radioisotopes of 131I and 18F-FDG. In particular, new ETCC with LaBr3 pixel scintillator provides good images similar to SPECT for 131I and human PET for 511keV, respectively, where a clear concentration to tumors in a mouse is observed The 30cm-cube ETCC can get an image for 1m-size length objects in one measurement. Thus, we have carried out several comparisons of our images with those of SPECT and PET. Multi-tracer image using I-131 and FDG for small animal and the image for higher energy gamma ray above 511keV for plants using 54Mn have been carried out successfully. Also several new biomarkers and new radio nuclides were examined to verify the merits of ETCC for medical imaging.},

	abstract = {It is an on-going challenge to verify the proton range in situ during proton therapy. Since the protons stop in target tissue, measurement of gamma-rays emitted either promptly from nuclear de-excitation or in pair from positron annihilation is the feasible method to monitor the proton range in-vivo. Using the technique of gamma collimation, we empirically demonstrated that the proton range and prompt gamma distribution are well correlated in the therapy energy range, and that measuring prompt gammas is a viable method for the clinical application. However, this collimation technique appears not to be applicable to passively scattered proton beams. The device chosen for gamma imaging in 2D is an electron tracking Compton camera, which images single-emission photons employing a gas chamber to induce Compton scattering. Images of prompt gammas were attained at the proton beam energy of 140 MeV. Measurements showed that gamma image in the energy range of 800–2000 keV provides a better match with the proton range compared to the image by lower energy gammas.},

@article{Grevillot_2011,
	Abstract = {This work proposes a generic method for modeling scanned ion beam delivery systems, without simulation of the treatment nozzle and based exclusively on beam data library (BDL) measurements required for treatment planning systems (TPS). To this aim, new tools dedicated to treatment plan simulation were implemented in the Gate Monte Carlo platform. The method was applied to a dedicated nozzle from IBA for proton pencil beam scanning delivery. Optical and energy parameters of the system were modeled using a set of proton depth-dose profiles and spot sizes measured at 27 therapeutic energies. For further validation of the beam model, specific 2D and 3D plans were produced and then measured with appropriate dosimetric tools. Dose contributions from secondary particles produced by nuclear interactions were also investigated using field size factor experiments. Pristine Bragg peaks were reproduced with 0.7 mm range and 0.2 mm spot size accuracy. A 32 cm range spread-out Bragg peak with 10 cm modulation was reproduced with 0.8 mm range accuracy and a maximum point-to-point dose difference of less than 2%. A 2D test pattern consisting of a combination of homogeneous and high-gradient dose regions passed a 2%/2 mm gamma index comparison for 97% of the points. In conclusion, the generic modeling method proposed for scanned ion beam delivery systems was applicable to an IBA proton therapy system. The key advantage of the method is that it only requires BDL measurements of the system. The validation tests performed so far demonstrated that the beam model achieves clinical performance, paving the way for further studies toward TPS benchmarking. The method involves new sources that are available in the new Gate release V6.1 and could be further applied to other particle therapy systems delivering protons or other types of ions like carbon.},

	abstract = {We used a mobile positron emission tomography (PET) scanner positioned within the proton therapy treatment room to study the feasibility of proton range verification with an in-room, stand-alone PET system, and compared with off-line equivalent studies. Two subjects with adenoid cystic carcinoma were enrolled into a pilot study in which in-room PET scans were acquired in list-mode after a routine fractionated treatment session. The list-mode PET data were reconstructed with different time schemes to generate in-room short, in-room long and off-line equivalent (by skipping coincidences from the first 15 min during the list-mode reconstruction) PET images for comparison in activity distribution patterns. A phantom study was followed to evaluate the accuracy of range verification for different reconstruction time schemes quantitatively. The in-room PET has a higher sensitivity compared to the off-line modality so that the PET acquisition time can be greatly reduced from 30 to {\textless}5 min. Features in deep-site, soft-tissue regions were better retained with in-room short PET acquisitions because of the collection of (15)O component and lower biological washout. For soft tissue-equivalent material, the distal fall-off edge of an in-room short acquisition is deeper compared to an off-line equivalent scan, indicating a better coverage of the high-dose end of the beam. In-room PET is a promising low cost, high sensitivity modality for the in vivo verification of proton therapy. Better accuracy in Monte Carlo predictions, especially for biological decay modeling, is necessary.},

	abstract = {Proton therapy is a form of radiotherapy that enables concentration of dose on a tumor by use of a scanned or modulated Bragg peak. Therefore, it is very important to evaluate the proton-irradiated volume accurately. The proton-irradiated volume can be confirmed by detection of pair-annihilation gamma rays from positron-emitting nuclei generated by the nuclear fragmentation reaction of the incident protons on target nuclei using a PET apparatus. The activity of the positron-emitting nuclei generated in a patient was measured with a PET-CT apparatus after proton beam irradiation of the patient. Activity measurement was performed in patients with tumors of the brain, head and neck, liver, lungs, and sacrum. The 3-D PET image obtained on the CT image showed the visual correspondence with the irradiation area of the proton beam. Moreover, it was confirmed that there were differences in the strength of activity from the PET-CT images obtained at each irradiation site. The values of activity obtained from both measurement and calculation based on the reaction cross section were compared, and it was confirmed that the intensity and the distribution of the activity changed with the start time of the PET imaging after proton beam irradiation. The clinical use of this information about the positron-emitting nuclei will be important for promoting proton treatment with higher accuracy in the future.},
